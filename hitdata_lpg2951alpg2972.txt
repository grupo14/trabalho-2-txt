CBS is a unique heme-containing enzyme that catalyzes a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent condensation of serine and homocysteine to give cystathionine. Deficiency of CBS leads to homocystinuria, an inherited disease of sulfur metabolism characterized by increased levels of the toxic metabolite homocysteine. Cysteine synthase on the other hand catalyzes the last step of cysteine biosynthesis. This subgroup also includes an O-Phosphoserine sulfhydrylase found in hyperthermophilic archaea which produces L-cysteine from sulfide and the more thermostable O-phospho-L-serine.

This CD corresponds to aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase (ACCD), tryptophan synthase beta chain (Trp-synth_B), cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase (CS), serine dehydratase (Ser-dehyd), threonine dehydratase (Thr-dehyd), diaminopropionate ammonia lyase (DAL), and threonine synthase (Thr-synth). ACCD catalyzes the conversion of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate to alpha-ketobutyrate and ammonia. Tryptophan synthase folds into a tetramer, where the beta chain is the catalytic PLP-binding subunit and catalyzes the formation of L-tryptophan from indole and L-serine. CBS is a tetrameric hemeprotein that catalyzes condensation of serine and homocysteine to cystathionine. CS is a homodimer that catalyzes the formation of L-cysteine from O-acetyl-L-serine. Ser-dehyd catalyzes the conversion of L- or D-serine to pyruvate and ammonia. Thr-dehyd is active as a homodimer and catalyzes the conversion of L-threonine to 2-oxobutanoate and ammonia. DAL is also a homodimer and catalyzes the alpha, beta-elimination reaction of both L- and D-alpha, beta-diaminopropionate to form pyruvate and ammonia. Thr-synth catalyzes the formation of threonine and inorganic phosphate from O-phosphohomoserine. Q#1 - YP_096944.1[cystathionine beta-lyase [Legionella pneumophila subsp. pneumophila str.

IHF is a nucleoid-associated protein (NAP) that binds and sharply bends many DNA targets in a sequence specific manner. It is a heterodimeric protein composed of two highly homologous subunits IHFA (IHF-alpha) and IHFB (IHF-beta). It is known to act as a transcription factor at many gene regulatory regions in E. coli. IHF is an essential cofactor in phage lambda site-specific recombination, having an architectural role during assembly of specialized nucleoprotein structures (snups). IHF is also involved in formation as well as maintenance of bacterial biofilms since it is found in complex with extracellular DNA (eDNA) within the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) matrix of many biofilms.

IHF binds DNA in a sequence specific manner while HU displays little or no sequence preference. IHF homologs are usually heterodimers, while HU homologs are typically homodimers (except HU heterodimers from E. coli and other enterobacteria). HU is highly basic and contributes to chromosomal compaction and maintenance of negative supercoiling, thus often referred to as histone-like protein. IHF is an essential cofactor in phage lambda site-specific recombination, having an architectural role during assembly of specialized nucleoprotein structures (snups). Bacillus phage SPO1-encoded transcription factor 1 (TF1) is another related type II DNA-binding protein. Like IHF, TF1 binds DNA specifically and bends DNA sharply.

They catalyze the hydrolysis of the dUTP-Mg complex (dUTP-Mg) into dUMP and pyrophosphate. This reaction is crucial for the preservation of chromosomal integrity as it removes dUTP and therefore reduces the cellular dUTP/dTTP ratio, and prevents dUTP from being incorporated into DNA. It also provides dUMP as the precursor for dTTP synthesis via the thymidylate synthase pathway. dUTPases are homotrimeric, except some monomeric viral dUTPases, which have been shown to mimic a trimer.

The conserved domain common to the SPFH superfamily has also been referred to as the Band 7 domain. Individual proteins of the SPFH superfamily may cluster to form membrane microdomains which may in turn recruit multiprotein complexes. Bacterial and archaebacterial SLPs remain uncharacterized. This subgroup contains PH1511 from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshi. Q#7 - YP_096950.1[stomatin like transmembrane protein [Legionella pneumophila subsp. pneumophila str.

The conserved domain common to the SPFH superfamily has also been referred to as the Band 7 domain. Many superfamily members are associated with lipid rafts. Individual proteins of the SPFH superfamily may cluster to form membrane microdomains which may in turn recruit multiprotein complexes. Microdomains formed from flotillin proteins may in addition be dynamic units with their own regulatory functions. Flotillins have been implicated in signal transduction, vesicle trafficking, cytoskeleton rearrangement and are known to interact with a variety of proteins. Stomatin interacts with and regulates members of the degenerin/epithelia Na+ channel family in mechanosensory cells of Caenorhabditis elegans and vertebrate neurons, and participates in trafficking of Glut1 glucose transporters. Prohibitin may act as a chaperone for the stabilization of mitochondrial proteins. Prokaryotic HflK/C plays a role in the decision between lysogenic and lytic cycle growth during lambda phage infection. Flotillins have been implicated in the progression of prion disease, in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, and in cancer invasion and metastasis. Mutations in the podocin gene give rise to autosomal recessive steroid resistant nephritic syndrome.

Currently, more than 300 NfeD homologs have been identified - all of which are bacterial or archaeal in origin. Majority of these genomes have been shown to possess operons containing a homologous NfeD/stomatin gene pair, causing NfeD to be previously named STOPP (stomatin operon partner protein). NfeD homologs can be divided into two groups: long and short forms. Long-form homologs have a putative ClpP-class serine protease domain while the short form homologs do not. Downstream from the ClpP-class domain is the so-called NfeD or DUF107 domain. N-terminal region of the NfeD homolog PH1510 (1510-N or PH1510-N) from Pyrococcus horikoshii has been shown to possess serine protease activity and has a Ser-Lys catalytic dyad, preferentially cleaving hydrophobic substrates. Difference in oligomeric form and catalytic residues between 1510-N (forming a dimer) and ClpP (forming a tetradecamer) shows a possible functional difference: 1510-N is likely to have a regulatory function while ClpP is involved in protein quality control.

This superfamily contains a diverse set of enzymes including enoyl-CoA hydratase, napthoate synthase, methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase, 3-hydoxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase, and dienoyl-CoA isomerase. Many of these play important roles in fatty acid metabolism. In addition to a conserved structural core and the formation of trimers (or dimers of trimers), a common feature in this superfamily is the stabilization of an enolate anion intermediate derived from an acyl-CoA substrate. This is accomplished by two conserved backbone NH groups in active sites that form an oxyanion hole. Q#8 - YP_096951.1[hypothetical protein lpg2958 [Legionella pneumophila subsp. pneumophila str.

It contains three conserved sequence motifs termed ExoI, ExoII and ExoIII, with a specific Hx(4)D conserved pattern at ExoIII. These motifs are clustered around the active site and contain four conserved acidic residues that serve as ligands for the two metal ions required for catalysis. RNase T is related to the proofreading domain of DNA polymerase III. Despite its important role, RNase T is mainly found only in gammaproteobacteria.

The functional unit of typical 2-cys PRX is a homodimer. A unique intermolecular redox-active disulfide center is utilized for its activity. Upon reaction with peroxides, its peroxidatic cysteine is oxidized into a sulfenic acid intermediate which is resolved by bonding with the resolving cysteine from the other subunit of the homodimer. This intermolecular disulfide bond is then reduced by thioredoxin, tryparedoxin or AhpF. Typical 2-cys PRXs, like 1-cys PRXs, form decamers which are stabilized by reduction of the active site cysteine. Typical 2-cys PRX interacts through beta strands at one edge of the monomer (B-type interface) to form the functional homodimer, and uses an A-type interface (similar to the dimeric interface in atypical 2-cys PRX and PRX5) at the opposite end of the monomer to form the stable decameric (pentamer of dimers) structure.

The major groups in this CD correspond to ornithine aminotransferase, acetylornithine aminotransferase, alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase, dialkylglycine decarboxylase, 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase, beta-alanine-pyruvate aminotransferase, adenosylmethionine-8-amino-7-oxononanoate aminotransferase, and glutamate-1-semialdehyde 2,1-aminomutase. All the enzymes belonging to this family act on basic amino acids and their derivatives are involved in transamination or decarboxylation.

PLP combines with an alpha-amino acid to form a compound called a Schiff base or aldimine intermediate, which depending on the reaction, is the substrate in four kinds of reactions (1) transamination (movement of amino groups), (2) racemization (redistribution of enantiomers), (3) decarboxylation (removing COOH groups), and (4) various side-chain reactions depending on the enzyme involved. Pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) dependent enzymes were previously classified into alpha, beta and gamma classes, based on the chemical characteristics (carbon atom involved) of the reaction they catalyzed. The availability of several structures allowed a comprehensive analysis of the evolutionary classification of PLP dependent enzymes, and it was found that the functional classification did not always agree with the evolutionary history of these enzymes. Structure and sequence analysis has revealed that the PLP dependent enzymes can be classified into four major groups of different evolutionary origin: aspartate aminotransferase superfamily (fold type I), tryptophan synthase beta superfamily (fold type II), alanine racemase superfamily (fold type III), and D-amino acid superfamily (fold type IV) and Glycogen phophorylase family (fold type V).

PI-PLCs are ubiquitous enzymes hydrolyzing the membrane lipid phosphoinositides to yield two important second messengers, inositol phosphates and diacylglycerol (DAG). GP-GDEs play essential roles in glycerol metabolism and catalyze the hydrolysis of glycerophosphodiesters to sn-glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) and the corresponding alcohols that are major sources of carbon and phosphate. Both, PI-PLCs and GP-GDEs, can hydrolyze the 3'-5' phosphodiester bonds in different substrates, and utilize a similar mechanism of general base and acid catalysis with conserved histidine residues, which consists of two steps, a phosphotransfer and a phosphodiesterase reaction. This superfamily also includes Neurospora crassa ankyrin repeat protein NUC-2 and its Saccharomyces cerevisiae counterpart, Phosphate system positive regulatory protein PHO81, glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase (GP-GDE)-like protein SHV3 and SHV3-like proteins (SVLs). The residues essential for enzyme activities and metal binding are not conserved in these sequence homologs, which might suggest that the function of catalytic domains in these proteins might be distinct from those in typical PLC-like phosphodiesterases.

ME has been found in all organisms, and plays important roles in diverse metabolic pathways such as photosynthesis and lipogenesis. This enzyme generally forms homotetramers. The conversion of malate to pyruvate by ME typically involves oxidation of malate to produce oxaloacetate, followed by decarboxylation of oxaloacetate to produce pyruvate and CO2. This subfamily consists of eukaryotic and bacterial ME. Amino acid DH-like NAD(P)-binding domains are members of the Rossmann fold superfamily and include glutamate, leucine, and phenylalanine DHs, methylene tetrahydrofolate DH, methylene-tetrahydromethanopterin DH, methylene-tetrahydropholate DH/cyclohydrolase, Shikimate DH-like proteins, malate oxidoreductases, and glutamyl tRNA reductase. Amino acid DHs catalyze the deamination of amino acids to keto acids with NAD(P)+ as a cofactor. The NAD(P)-binding Rossmann fold superfamily includes a wide variety of protein families including NAD(P)- binding domains of alcohol DHs, tyrosine-dependent oxidoreductases, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate DH, lactate/malate DHs, formate/glycerate DHs, siroheme synthases, 6-phosphogluconate DH, amino acid DHs, repressor rex, NAD-binding potassium channel domain, CoA-binding, and ornithine cyclodeaminase-like domains. These domains have an alpha-beta-alpha configuration. NAD binding involves numerous hydrogen and van der Waals contacts.

Classical SDRs are typically about 250 residues long, while extended SDRs are approximately 350 residues. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold NAD-binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns. These enzymes catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human prostaglandin dehydrogenase (PGDH) numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, PGDH numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, PGDH numbering) contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Extended SDRs have additional elements in the C-terminal region, and typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase (KR) domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type KRs have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif. Some atypical SDRs have lost catalytic activity and/or have an unusual NAD(P)-binding motif and missing or unusual active site residues. Reactions catalyzed within the SDR family include isomerization, decarboxylation, epimerization, C=N bond reduction, dehydratase activity, dehalogenation, Enoyl-CoA reduction, and carbonyl-alcohol oxidoreduction.
