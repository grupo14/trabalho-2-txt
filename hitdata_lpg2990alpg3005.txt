This model and hierarchy represent the ligand binding domains of the LacI family of transcriptional regulators, periplasmic binding proteins of the ABC-type transport systems, the family C G-protein couples receptors (GPCRs), membrane bound guanylyl cyclases including the family of natriuretic peptide receptors (NPRs), and the N-terminal leucine/isoleucine/valine- binding protein  (LIVBP)-like domains of the ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs). In LacI-like transcriptional regulator and the bacterial periplasmic binding proteins the ligands are monosaccharides including lactose, ribose, fructose, xylose, arabinose, galactose/glucose, and other sugars, with a few exceptions.  Periplasmic sugar binding proteins are one of the components of ABC transporters and are involved in the active transport of water-soluble ligands. The LacI family of proteins consists of transcriptional regulators related to the lac repressor. In this case, the sugar binding domain binds a sugar which changes the DNA binding activity of the repressor domain. The periplasmic binding proteins are the primary receptors for chemotaxis and transport of many sugar based solutes. The core structures of periplasmic binding proteins are classified into two types, and they differ in number and order of beta strands: type 1 has  six beta strands, while type 2 has five beta strands per sub-domain. These two structural folds are thought to be distantly related via a common ancestor. Notably, while the N-terminal LIVBP-like domain of iGluRs belongs to the type 1 periplasmic-binding fold protein superfamily, the glutamate-binding domain of the iGluR is structurally similar to the type 2 periplasmic-binding fold.

RsmI proteins employ the 30S subunit (not the 16S rRNA) as a substrate, suggesting that the methylation reaction occurs at a late step during 30S assembly in the cell.
Q#7 - YP_096988.1[tetrapyrrole (corrin/porphyrin) methylase [Legionella pneumophila subsp. pneumophila str. Philadelphia 1]]	superfamily	275518	12	232	5.7224e-123	353.222	cl00304	TP_methylase superfamily	 - 	 - 	S-AdoMet dependent tetrapyrrole methylases; This family uses S-AdoMet (S-adenosyl-L-methionine or SAM) in the methylation of diverse substrates. Most members catalyze various methylation steps in cobalamin (vitamin B12) biosynthesis. There are two distinct cobalamin biosynthetic pathways in bacteria. The aerobic pathway requires oxygen, and cobalt is inserted late in the pathway; the anaerobic pathway does not require oxygen, and cobalt insertion is the first committed step towards cobalamin synthesis. The enzymes involved in the aerobic pathway are prefixed Cob and those of the anaerobic pathway Cbi. Most of the enzymes are shared by both pathways and a few enzymes are pathway-specific. Diphthine synthase and Ribosomal RNA small subunit methyltransferase I (RsmI) are two superfamily members that are not involved in cobalamin biosynthesis. Diphthine synthase participates in the posttranslational modification of a specific histidine residue in elongation factor 2 (EF-2) of eukaryotes and archaea to diphthamide. RsmI catalyzes the 2-O-methylation of the ribose of cytidine 1402 (C1402) in 16S rRNA using S-adenosylmethionine (Ado-Met) as the methyl donor.
Q#8 - YP_096989.1[alkane-1 monooxygenase [Legionella pneumophila subsp. pneumophila str. Philadelphia 1]]	specific	239589	61	375	8.61331e-154	439.403	cd03512	Alkane-hydroxylase	 - 	cl00615	Alkane hydroxylase is a bacterial, integral-membrane di-iron enzyme that shares a requirement for iron and oxygen for activity similar to that of the non-heme integral-membrane acyl coenzyme A (CoA) desaturases and acyl lipid desaturases. The alk genes in Pseudomonas oleovorans encode conversion of alkanes to acyl CoA. The alkane omega-hydroxylase (AlkB) system is responsible for the initial oxidation of inactivated alkanes. It is a three-component system comprising a soluble NADH-rubredoxin reductase (AlkT), a soluble rubredoxin (AlkG), and the integral membrane oxygenase (AlkB). AlkB utilizes the oxygen rebound mechanism to hydroxylate alkanes. This mechanism involves homolytic cleavage of the C-H bond by an electrophilic metal-oxo intermediate to generate a substrate-based radical. As with other members of this superfamily, this domain family has extensive hydrophobic regions that would be capable of spanning the membrane bilayer at least twice. The active site structure of AlkB is not known, however, spectroscopic and genetic evidence points to a nitrogen-rich coordination environment located in the cytoplasm with as many as eight histidines coordinating the two iron ions and a carboxylate residue bridging the two metals. Like all other members of this superfamily, there are eight conserved histidines seen in the histidine cluster motifs: HXXXH, HXXXHH, and HXXHH. These histidine residues are reported to be catalytically essential and proposed to be the ligands for the iron atoms contained within the homolog, stearoyl CoA desaturase. Also included in this CD are terminal alkane hydroxylases (AlkM), xylene monooxygenase hydroxylases (XylM), p-cymene monooxygenase hydroxylases (CymAa), and other related proteins.

They are present in all groups of organisms with the exception of archaea. Membrane FADSs are non-heme, iron-containing, oxygen-dependent enzymes involved in regioselective introduction of double bonds in fatty acyl aliphatic chains. They play an important role in the maintenance of the proper structure and functioning of biological membranes. Alkane hydroxylases are bacterial, integral-membrane di-iron enzymes that share a requirement for iron and oxygen for activity similar to that of membrane FADSs, and are involved in the initial oxidation of inactivated alkanes. Beta-carotene ketolase and beta-carotene hydroxylase are carotenoid biosynthetic enzymes for astaxanthin and zeaxanthin, respectively. This superfamily domain has extensive hydrophobic regions that would be capable of spanning the membrane bilayer at least twice. Comparison of these sequences also reveals three regions of conserved histidine cluster motifs that contain eight histidine residues: HXXX(X)H, HXX(X)HH, and HXXHH (an additional conserved histidine residue is seen between clusters 2 and 3). Spectroscopic and genetic evidence point to a nitrogen-rich coordination environment located in the cytoplasm with as many as eight histidines coordinating the two iron ions and a carboxylate residue bridging the two metals in the Pseudomonas oleovorans alkane hydroxylase (AlkB). In addition, the eight histidine residues are reported to be catalytically essential and proposed to be the ligands for the iron atoms contained within the rat stearoyl CoA delta-9 desaturase.

It controls modification of the uridine at the wobble position (U34) of tRNAs that read codons ending with A or G in the mixed codon family boxes. TrmE contains a GTPase domain that forms a canonical Ras-like fold. It functions a molecular switch GTPase, and apparently uses a conformational change associated with GTP hydrolysis to promote the tRNA modification reaction, in which the conserved cysteine in the C-terminal domain is thought to function as a catalytic residue. In bacteria that are able to survive in extremely low pH conditions, TrmE regulates glutamate-dependent acid resistance.

This domain appears to be univeral among bacteria (although absent from Archaea). The well-characterized YidC protein from Escherichia coli and its close homologs contain a large N-terminal periplasmic domain in addition to the region modeled here.
