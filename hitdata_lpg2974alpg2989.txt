These enzymes catalyse the reaction: Phosphatidyl-L-serine <=> phosphatidylethanolamine + CO2. Phosphatidylserine decarboxylase plays a central role in the biosynthesis of aminophospholipids by converting phosphatidylserine to phosphatidylethanolamine.

These enzymes have a two-domain structure with the active site between the domains. The N-terminal domain contains the HEXXH zinc-binding motif while the helical C-terminal domain, which is unique for the family, carries the third zinc ligand. Most of these secreted proteases degrade extracellular proteins and peptides for bacterial nutrition, especially prior to sporulation. They have N-terminal propeptides that assist in folding and are removed autocatalytically. Thermolysin is widely used as a nonspecific protease to obtain fragments for peptide sequencing. It has also been used in production of the artificial sweetener aspartame. Q#4 - YP_096969.1[zinc metalloprotease [Legionella pneumophila subsp. pneumophila str. Philadelphia 1]] superfamily 276065 180 442 4.94141e-78 246.433 cl14813 GluZincin superfamily - - Peptidase Gluzincin family (thermolysin-like proteinases, TLPs) includes peptidases M1, M2, M3, M4, M13, M32 and M36 (fungalysins); Gluzincin family (thermolysin-like peptidases or TLPs) includes several zinc-dependent metallopeptidases such as the M1, M2, M3, M4, M13, M32, M36 peptidases (MEROPS classification), and contain HEXXH and EXXXD motifs as part of their active site. All peptidases in this family bind a single catalytic zinc ion which is tetrahedrally co-ordinated by three amino acid ligands and a water molecule that forms the nucleophile on activation during catalysis. M1 family includes aminopeptidase N (APN) and leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H). APN preferentially cleaves neutral amino acids from the N-terminus of oligopeptides and is present in a variety of human tissues and cell types. LTA4H is a bifunctional enzyme, possessing an aminopeptidase as well as an epoxide hydrolase activity such that the two activities occupy different, but overlapping sites. The peptidase M3 or neurolysin-like family, includes M3, M2 and M32 metallopeptidases. The M3 peptidases have two subfamilies: M3A, includes thimet oligopeptidase (TOP; endopeptidase 3.4.24.15), neurolysin (3.4.24.16), and the mitochondrial intermediate peptidase; M3B contains oligopeptidase F. M2 peptidase angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, EC 3.4.15.1) catalyzes the conversion of decapeptide angiotensin I to the potent vasopressor octapeptide angiotensin II. ACE is a key part of the renin-angiotensin system that regulates blood pressure, thus ACE inhibitors are important for the treatment of hypertension. M32 family includes two eukaryotic enzymes from protozoa Trypanosoma cruzi, a causative agent of Chagas' disease, and Leishmania major, a parasite that causes leishmaniasis, making them attractive targets for drug development. The M4 family includes secreted protease thermolysin (EC 3.4.24.27), pseudolysin, aureolysin, neutral protease as well as fungalysin and bacillolysin (EC 3.4.24.28) that degrade extracellular proteins and peptides for bacterial nutrition, especially prior to sporulation. Thermolysin is widely used as a nonspecific protease to obtain fragments for peptide sequencing as well as in production of the artificial sweetener aspartame. M13 family includes neprilysin (EC 3.4.24.11) and endothelin-converting enzyme I (ECE-1, EC 3.4.24.71), which fulfill a broad range of physiological roles due to the greater variation in the S2' subsite allowing substrate specificity and are prime therapeutic targets for selective inhibition. Peptidase M36 (fungamysin) family includes endopeptidases from pathogenic fungi. Fungalysin hydrolyzes extracellular matrix proteins such as elastin and keratin. Aspergillus fumigatus causes the pulmonary disease aspergillosis by invading the lungs of immuno-compromised animals and secreting fungalysin that possibly breaks down proteinaceous structural barriers.

Philadelphia 1]] superfamily 276298 5 118 2.34186e-08 50.2738 cl21454 SDR superfamily - - Short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR); SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet), an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Classical SDRs are typically about 250 residues long, while extended SDRs are approximately 350 residues. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold NAD-binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns. These enzymes catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human prostaglandin dehydrogenase (PGDH) numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, PGDH numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, PGDH numbering) contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Extended SDRs have additional elements in the C-terminal region, and typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase (KR) domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type KRs have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif. Some atypical SDRs have lost catalytic activity and/or have an unusual NAD(P)-binding motif and missing or unusual active site residues. Reactions catalyzed within the SDR family include isomerization, decarboxylation, epimerization, C=N bond reduction, dehydratase activity, dehalogenation, Enoyl-CoA reduction, and carbonyl-alcohol oxidoreduction.
