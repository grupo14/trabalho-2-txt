Endonuclease III is an iron-sulfur protein that binds a single 4Fe-4S cluster. The 4Fe-4S cluster does not seem to be important for catalytic activity, but is probably involved in the proper positioning of the enzyme along the DNA strand. The 4Fe-4S cluster is bound by four cysteines which are all located in a 17 amino acid region at the C-terminal end of endonuclease III. A similar region is also present in the central section of mutY and in the C-terminus of ORF-10 and of the Micro-coccus UV endonuclease.

These proteins have a conserved alpha-beta rossman fold domain. HCP, formerly known as prismane, is thought to play a role in nitrogen metabolism but its specific function is unknown.  Acetyl-CoA synthase (ACS), is found in acetogenic and methanogenic organisms and is responsible for the synthesis and breakdown of acetyl-CoA. ACS forms a heterotetramer with carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH) consisting of two ACS and two CODH subunits. CODH reduces carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide and ACS then synthesizes acetyl-CoA from carbon monoxide and CoA.

This class I enzyme aminoacylates the 2&apos;-OH of the nucleotide at the 3&apos; of the appropriate tRNA. MetRS, which consists of the core domain and an anti-codon binding domain, functions as a monomer. However, in some species the anti-codon binding domain is followed by an EMAP domain. In this case, MetRS functions as a homodimer. The core domain is based on the Rossman fold and is responsible for the ATP-dependent formation of the enzyme bound aminoacyl-adenylate. It contains the characteristic class I HIGH and KMSKS motifs, which are involved in ATP binding.  As a result of a deletion event, MetRS has a significantly shorter core domain insertion than IleRS, ValRS, and LeuR.  Consequently, the MetRS insertion lacks the editing function.

This domain is found in a diverse collection of tRNA binding proteins, including prokaryotic phenylalanyl tRNA synthetases (PheRS), methionyl-tRNA synthetases (MetRS), human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase(hTyrRS), Saccharomyces cerevisiae Arc1p, Thermus thermophilus CsaA, Aquifex aeolicus Trbp111, human p43 and human EMAP-II. PheRS, MetRS and hTyrRS aminoacylate their cognate tRNAs.  Arc1p is a transactivator of yeast methionyl-tRNA and glutamyl-tRNA synthetases.  The molecular chaperones Trbp111 and CsaA also contain this domain.  CsaA has export related activities; Trbp111 is structure-specific recognizing the L-shape of the tRNA fold. This domain has general tRNA binding properties.  In a subset of this family this domain has the added capability of a cytokine. For example the p43 component of the Human aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex is cleaved to release EMAP-II cytokine. EMAP-II has multiple activities during apoptosis, angiogenesis and inflammation and participates in malignant transformation. An EMAP-II-like cytokine is released from hTyrRS upon cleavage. The active cytokine heptapeptide locates to this domain. For homodimeric members of this group which include CsaA, Trbp111 and Escherichia coli MetRS this domain acts as a dimerization domain.

The ClC chloride channels catalyse the selective flow of Cl- ions across cell membranes, thereby regulating electrical excitation in skeletal muscle and the flow of salt and water across epithelial barriers. This domain is found in the halogen ions (Cl-, Br- and I-) transport proteins of the ClC family.  The ClC channels are found in all three kingdoms of life and perform a variety of functions including cellular excitability regulation, cell volume regulation, membrane potential stabilization, acidification of intracellular organelles, signal transduction, transepithelial transport in animals, and the extreme acid resistance response in eubacteria.  They lack any structural or sequence similarity to other known ion channels and exhibit unique properties of ion permeation and gating.  Unlike cation-selective ion channels, which form oligomers containing a single pore along the axis of symmetry, the ClC channels form two-pore homodimers with one pore per subunit without axial symmetry.  Although lacking the typical voltage-sensor found in cation channels, all studied ClC channels are gated (opened and closed) by transmembrane voltage. The gating is conferred by the permeating ion itself, acting as the gating charge.  In addition, eukaryotic and some prokaryotic ClC channels have two additional C-terminal CBS (cystathionine beta synthase) domains of putative regulatory function.

Mannose is a key monosaccharide for glycosylation of proteins and lipids. GDP-Mannose is the activated donor for mannosylation of various biomolecules. This enzyme is known to be bifunctional, as both mannose-6-phosphate isomerase and mannose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase. This CD covers the N-terminal GDP-mannose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase domain, whereas the isomerase function is located at the C-terminal half. GDP-MP is a member of the nucleotidyltransferase family of enzymes.

Based on the stereochemistry of the donor and acceptor molecules, GTs are classified as either retaining or inverting enzymes. To date, all GT structures adopt one of two possible folds, termed GT-A fold and GT-B fold.  This hierarchy includes diverse families of glycosyl transferases with a common GT-A type structural fold, which has two tightly associated beta/alpha/beta domains that tend to form a continuous central sheet of at least eight beta-strands. The majority of the proteins in this superfamily are Glycosyltransferase family 2 (GT-2) proteins.

Autophagy in a eukaryotic mechanism in which cytoplasm is enclosed in double-membraned autophagosomes which fuse with a vacuole for transport into the lumen. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, alpha-mannosidase is selectively directed to the vacuole via the direct interaction with Atg19 (and paralog Atg34) in the Cvt pathway. Ams1 binding domains (ABD) Atg19/34 have a immunoglobulin fold with eight beta-strands. The ABD is responsible for Ams1 recognition, but its deletion does not affect the fusion of Atg19 with prApe1, and the transport of prApe1 to the vacuole. The Atg19 N-terminal region is a distinct coiled-coil domain.

ParB binds to DNA sequences adjacent to the origin of replication and localizes to opposite cell poles shortly following the initiation of DNA replication. ParB regulates the ParA ATPase activity by promoting nucleotide exchange in a fashion reminiscent of the exchange factors of eukaryotic G proteins. ADP-bound ParA binds single-stranded DNA, whereas the ATP-bound form dissociates ParB from its DNA binding sites. Increasing the fraction of ParA-ADP in the cell inhibits cell division, suggesting that this simple nucleotide switch may regulate cytokinesis. ParA shares sequence similarity to a conserved and widespread family of ATPases which includes the repA protein of the repABC operon in R. etli Sym plasmid. This operon is involved in the plasmid replication and partition.

Heme-copper oxidases are transmembrane protein complexes in the respiratory chains of prokaryotes and mitochondria which couple the reduction of molecular oxygen to water to, proton pumping across the membrane. The heme-copper oxidase superfamily is diverse in terms of electron donors, subunit composition, and heme types.  This superfamily includes cytochrome c and ubiquinol oxidases.  Bacterial oxidases typically contain 3 or 4 subunits in contrast to the 13 subunit bovine cytochrome c oxidase (CcO). Subunits I, II, and III of mammalian CcO are encoded within the mitochondrial genome and the remaining 10 subunits are encoded within the nuclear genome. Subunits I, II and III of ubiquinol oxidase are homologous to the corresponding subunits in CcO.  This group additionally contains proteins which are fusions between subunits I and III, such as Sulfolobus acidocaldarius SoxM, a subunit of the SoxM terminal oxidase complex. It also includes NorE which has been speculated to be a subunit of nitric oxide reductase. Some archaebacterial cytochrome oxidases lack subunit III.   Although not required for catalytic activity, subunit III is believed to play a role in assembly of the multimer complex. Rhodobacter CcO subunit III stabilizes the integrity of the binuclear center in subunit I.  It has been proposed that archaea acquired heme-copper oxidases through gene transfer from gram-positive bacteria.

This is essential for the stability of other structures in subunit I, for example haems a and a3, and the magnesium/manganese centre. Cox11 is probably only required in sub-stoichiometric amounts relative to the structural units. The C terminal region of the protein is known to form a dimer. Each monomer coordinates one Cu(I) ion via three conserved cysteine residues (111, 208 and 210) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Subunits I, II, and III of mammalian CcO are encoded within the mitochondrial genome and the remaining 10 subunits are encoded within the nuclear genome. Subunit I contains a heme-copper binuclear center (the active site where O2 is reduced to water) formed by a high-spin heme (heme a3) and a copper ion (CuB).  It also contains a low-spin heme (heme a), believed to participate in the transfer of electrons to the binuclear center.  For every reduction of an O2 molecule, eight protons are taken from the inside aqueous compartment and four electrons are taken from cytochrome c on the opposite side of the membrane.  The four electrons and four of the protons are used in the reduction of O2; the four remaining protons are pumped across the membrane.  This charge separation of four charges contributes to the electrochemical gradient used for ATP synthesis. Two proton channels, the D-pathway and K-pathway, leading to the binuclear center have been identified in subunit I.  A well-defined pathway for the transfer of pumped protons beyond the binuclear center has not been identified. Electrons are transferred from cytochrome c (the electron donor) to heme a via the CuA binuclear site in subunit II, and directly from heme a to the binuclear center.
