MsrA, a protein involved in the reduction of methionine sulfoxides in proteins, has been known for four decades and has been extensively characterized with respect to structure and function. However, recent studies revealed that MsrA is only specific for methionine-S-sulfoxides. Because oxidized methionines occur in a mixture of R and S isomers in vivo, it was unclear how stereo-specific MsrA could be responsible for the reduction of all protein methionine sulfoxides. It appears that a second methionine sulfoxide reductase, SelR, evolved that is specific for methionine-R-sulfoxides, the activity that is different but complementary to that of MsrA. Thus, these proteins, working together, could reduce both stereoisomers of methionine sulfoxide. This domain is found both in SelR proteins and fused with the peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase enzymatic domain pfam01625. The domain has two conserved cysteine and histidines. The domain binds both selenium and zinc. The final cysteine is found to be replaced by the rare amino acid selenocysteine in some members of the family.

Classical SDRs are typically about 250 residues long, while extended SDRs are approximately 350 residues. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold NAD-binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns. These enzymes catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human prostaglandin dehydrogenase (PGDH) numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, PGDH numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, PGDH numbering) contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Extended SDRs have additional elements in the C-terminal region, and typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase (KR) domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type KRs have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif. Some atypical SDRs have lost catalytic activity and/or have an unusual NAD(P)-binding motif and missing or unusual active site residues. Reactions catalyzed within the SDR family include isomerization, decarboxylation, epimerization, C=N bond reduction, dehydratase activity, dehalogenation, Enoyl-CoA reduction, and carbonyl-alcohol oxidoreduction.

RelA synthesizes (p)ppGpp in response to amino-acid starvation and in association with ribosomes. (p)ppGpp triggers the bacterial stringent response. SpoT catalyzes (p)ppGpp synthesis under carbon limitation in a ribosome-independent manner. It also catalyzes (p)ppGpp degradation. Gram-negative bacteria have two enzymes involved in (p)ppGpp metabolism while most Gram-positive organisms have a single Rel-Spo enzyme (Rel), which both synthesizes and degrades (p)ppGpp. The Arabidopsis thaliana Rel-Spo proteins, At-RSH1,-2, and-3 appear to regulate a rapid (p)ppGpp-mediated response to pathogens and other stresses. This catalytic domain is found in association with an N-terminal HD domain and a C-terminal metal dependent phosphohydrolase domain (TGS).

Null mutations in apaH result in high intracellular levels of Ap(4)A which correlate with multiple phenotypes, including a decreased expression of catabolite-repressible genes, a reduction in the expression of flagellar operons, and an increased sensitivity to UV and heat. Ap4A hydrolase is important in responding to heat shock and oxidative stress via regulating the concentration of Ap4A in bacteria. Ap4A hydrolase is also thought to play a role in siderophore production, but the mechanism by which ApaH interacts with siderophore pathways in unknown.

FNR transfers electrons from reduced ferredoxin to FAD (forming FADH2 via a semiquinone intermediate) and then transfers a hydride ion to convert NADP+ to NADPH.

Group I TRX is a small ancient protein that alter the redox state of target proteins via the reversible oxidation of an active site dithiol, present in a CXXC motif, partially exposed at the protein's surface. TRX reduces protein disulfide bonds, resulting in a disulfide bond at its active site. Oxidized TRX is converted to the active form by TRX reductase, using reducing equivalents derived from either NADPH or ferredoxins. By altering their redox state, TRX regulates the functions of at least 30 target proteins, some of which are enzymes and transcription factors. It also plays an important role in the defense against oxidative stress by directly reducing hydrogen peroxide and certain radicals, and by serving as a reductant for peroxiredoxins. At least two major types of functional TRXs have been reported in most organisms; in eukaryotes, they are located in the cytoplasm and the mitochondria. Higher plants contain more types (at least 20 TRX genes have been detected in the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana), two of which (types f amd m) are located in the same compartment, the chloroplast. Also included in the alignment are TRX-like domains which show sequence homology to TRX but do not contain the redox active CXXC motif. Group II proteins, in addition to either a redox active TRX or a TRX-like domain, also contain additional domains, which may or may not possess homology to known proteins.
