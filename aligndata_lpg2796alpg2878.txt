Q#1 - YP_096792.1 [cell division protein FtsH [Legionella pneumophila subsp. pneumophila str. Philadelphia 1]]

>gnl|cdd|99707 AAA(Specific), 99707, cd00009; The AAA+ (ATPases Associated with 
a wide variety of cellular Activities) superfamily represents 
an ancient group of ATPases belonging to the ASCE (for 
additional strand, catalytic E) division of the P-loop NTPase 
fold. The ASCE division also includes ABC, RecA-like, VirD4-like, 
PilT-like, and SF1/2 helicases. Members of the AAA+ 
ATPases function as molecular chaperons, ATPase subunits of 
proteases, helicases, or nucleic-acid stimulated ATPases. The 
AAA+ proteins contain several distinct features in addition 
to the conserved alpha-beta-alpha core domain structure and 
the Walker A and B motifs of the P-loop NTPases.
ABC_ATPase(Superfamily), 
276299, cl21455, ATP-binding cassette transporter 
nucleotide-binding domain; ABC transporters are a large 
family of proteins involved in the transport of a wide variety 
of different compounds, like sugars, ions, peptides, and 
more complex organic molecules. The nucleotide-binding domain 
shows the highest similarity between all members of the 
family. ABC transporters are a subset of nucleotide hydrolases 
that contain a signature motif, Q-loop, and H-loop/switch 
region, in addition to, the Walker A motif/P-loop and Walker 
B motif commonly found in a number of ATP- and GTP-binding 
and hydrolyzing proteins

>gnl|cdd|253758 FtsH_ext(Specific), 253758, pfam06480, FtsH Extracellular; This 
domain is found in the FtsH family of proteins. FtsH is the 
only membrane-bound ATP-dependent protease universally conserved 
in prokaryotes. It only efficiently degrades proteins 
that have a low thermodynamic stability - e.g. it lacks robust 
unfoldase activity. This feature may be key and implies 
that this could be a criterion for degrading a protein. In 
Oenococcus oeni FtsH is involved in protection against environmental 
stress, and shows increased expression under heat or 
osmotic stress. These two lines of evidence suggest that it 
is a fundamental prokaryotic self-protection mechanism that 
checks if proteins are correctly folded (personal obs: Yeats 
C). The precise function of this N-terminal region is unclear.

>gnl|cdd|119392 MFS(Specific), 119392, cd06174; The Major Facilitator Superfamily 
(MFS) is a large and diverse group of secondary transporters 
that includes uniporters, symporters, and antiporters. 
MFS proteins facilitate the transport across cytoplasmic or 
internal membranes of a variety of substrates including ions, 
sugar phosphates, drugs, neurotransmitters, nucleosides, 
amino acids, and peptides. They do so using the electrochemical 
potential of the transported substrates. Uniporters transport 
a single substrate, while symporters and antiporters transport 
two substrates in the same or in opposite directions, 
respectively, across membranes. MFS proteins are typically 
400 to 600 amino acids in length, and the majority contain 
12 transmembrane alpha helices (TMs) connected by hydrophilic 
loops. The N- and C-terminal halves of these proteins display 
weak similarity and may be the result of a gene duplication/fusion 
event. Based on kinetic studies and the structures 
of a few bacterial superfamily members, GlpT (glycerol-3-phosphate 
transporter), LacY (lactose permease), and EmrD (multidrug 
transporter), MFS proteins are thought to function 
through a single substrate binding site, alternating-access 
mechanism involving a rocker-switch type of movement. Bacterial 
members function primarily for nutrient uptake, and as drug-efflux 
pumps to confer antibiotic resistance. Some MFS proteins 
have medical significance in humans such as the glucose 
transporter Glut4, which is impaired in type II diabetes, 
and glucose-6-phosphate transporter (G6PT), which causes glycogen 
storage disease when mutated.

Q#12 - YP_096803.1 [shikimate 5-dehydrogenase [Legionella pneumophila subsp. pneumophila str. Philadelphia 1]]

>gnl|cdd|133443 NAD_bind_Shikimate_DH(Specific), 133443, cd01065, NAD(P) binding 
domain of Shikimate dehydrogenase; Shikimate dehydrogenase 
(DH) is an amino acid DH family member. Shikimate pathway 
links metabolism of carbohydrates to de novo biosynthesis of 
aromatic amino acids, quinones and folate. It is essential 
in plants, bacteria, and fungi but absent in mammals, thus 
making enzymes involved in this pathway ideal targets for broad 
spectrum antibiotics and herbicides. Shikimate DH catalyzes 
the reduction of 3-hydroshikimate to shikimate using the 
cofactor NADH. Amino acid DH-like NAD(P)-binding domains are 
members of the Rossmann fold superfamily and include glutamate, 
leucine, and phenylalanine DHs, methylene tetrahydrofolate 
DH, methylene-tetrahydromethanopterin DH, methylene-tetrahydropholate 
DH/cyclohydrolase, Shikimate DH-like proteins, 
malate oxidoreductases, and glutamyl tRNA reductase. Amino 
acid DHs catalyze the deamination of amino acids to keto acids 
with NAD(P)+ as a cofactor. The NAD(P)-binding Rossmann 
fold superfamily includes a wide variety of protein families 
including NAD(P)- binding domains of alcohol DHs, tyrosine-dependent 
oxidoreductases, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate DH, lactate/malate 
DHs, formate/glycerate DHs, siroheme synthases, 
6-phosphogluconate DHs, amino acid DHs, repressor rex, NAD-binding 
potassium channel  domain, CoA-binding, and ornithine 
cyclodeaminase-like domains. These domains have an alpha-beta-alpha 
configuration. NAD binding involves numerous hydrogen 
and van der Waals contacts.
SDR(Superfamily), 276298, cl21454, 
Short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR); SDRs are 
a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have 
a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold 
(alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet), an NAD(P)(H)-binding 
region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal 
region. Classical SDRs are typically about 250 residues long, 
while extended SDRs are approximately 350 residues. Sequence 
identity between different SDR enzymes are typically in 
the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold 
NAD-binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic 
sequence patterns. These enzymes catalyze a wide range of 
activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, 
carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, 
and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG 
cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with 
the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical 
catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human prostaglandin dehydrogenase 
(PGDH) numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there 
is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, PGDH numbering) and/or 
an Asn (Asn-107, PGDH numbering) contributing to the active 
site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, 
which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism 
is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the 
conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, 
and nicotinamide. Extended SDRs have additional elements in 
the C-terminal region, and typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor 
binding motif. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase 
(KR) domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding 
motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). 
Fungal type KRs have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif. 
Some atypical SDRs have lost catalytic activity and/or have 
an unusual NAD(P)-binding motif and missing or unusual active 
site residues. Reactions catalyzed within the SDR family 
include isomerization, decarboxylation, epimerization, C=N bond 
reduction, dehydratase activity, dehalogenation, Enoyl-CoA 
reduction, and carbonyl-alcohol oxidoreduction

Q#13 - YP_096804.1 [aminopeptidase [Legionella pneumophila subsp. pneumophila str. Philadelphia 1]]

>gnl|cdd|189007 M1_APN_1(Specific), 189007, cd09600, Peptidase M1 family containing 
Aminopeptidase N; This family contains aminopeptidase 
N (APN; CD13; Alanyl aminopeptidase; EC 3.4.11.2), a Type II 
integral membrane protease belonging to the M1 gluzincin family. 
It includes bacterial-type alanyl aminopeptidases as 
well as PfA-M1 aminopeptidase (Plasmodium falciparum-type). 
APN consists of a small N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a single 
transmembrane domain and a large extracellular ectodomain 
that contains the active site. It preferentially cleaves neutral 
amino acids from the N-terminus of oligopeptides and, 
in higher eukaryotes, is present in a variety of human tissues 
and cell types (leukocyte, fibroblast, endothelial and epithelial 
cells). APN expression is dysregulated in inflammatory 
diseases such as chronic pain, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple 
sclerosis, systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, 
polymyositis/dermatomyosytis and pulmonary sarcoidosis, 
and is enhanced in tumor cells such as melanoma, renal, 
prostate, pancreas, colon, gastric and thyroid cancers. It is 
predominantly expressed on stem cells and on cells of the 
granulocytic and monocytic lineages at distinct stages of differentiation, 
thus considered a marker of differentiation. 
Thus, APN inhibition may lead to the development of anti-cancer 
and anti-inflammatory drugs. APNs are also present in many 
pathogenic bacteria and represent potential drug targets, 
Some APNs have been used commercially, such as one from Lactococcus 
lactis used in the food industry. APN also serves as 
a receptor for coronaviruses, although the virus receptor 
interaction site seems to be distinct from the enzymatic site 
and aminopeptidase activity is not necessary for viral infection. 
APNs have also been extensively studied as putative 
Cry toxin receptors. Cry1 proteins are pore-forming toxins that 
bind to the midgut epithelial cell membrane of susceptible 
insect larvae, causing extensive damage. Several different 
toxins, including Cry1Aa, Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac, Cry1Ba, Cry1Ca and 
Cry1Fa, have been shown to bind to APNs; however, a direct 
role of APN in cytotoxicity has been yet to be firmly established.

GluZincin(Superfamily), 276065, cl14813, Peptidase 
Gluzincin family (thermolysin-like proteinases, TLPs) includes 
peptidases M1, M2, M3, M4, M13, M32 and M36 (fungalysins); 
Gluzincin family (thermolysin-like peptidases or TLPs) includes 
several zinc-dependent metallopeptidases such as the M1, 
M2, M3, M4, M13, M32, M36 peptidases (MEROPS classification), 
and contain HEXXH and EXXXD motifs as part of their active 
site. All peptidases in this family bind a single catalytic 
zinc ion which is tetrahedrally co-ordinated by three amino 
acid ligands and a water molecule that forms the nucleophile 
on activation during catalysis. M1 family includes aminopeptidase 
N (APN) and leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H).  APN 
preferentially cleaves neutral amino acids from the N-terminus 
of oligopeptides and is present in a variety of human tissues 
and cell types. LTA4H is a bifunctional enzyme, possessing 
an aminopeptidase as well as an epoxide hydrolase activity 
such that the two activities occupy different, but overlapping 
sites. The peptidase M3 or neurolysin-like family, includes 
M3, M2 and M32 metallopeptidases.  The M3 peptidases 
have two subfamilies: M3A, includes thimet oligopeptidase (TOP; 
endopeptidase 3.4.24.15), neurolysin (3.4.24.16), and the 
mitochondrial intermediate peptidase; M3B contains oligopeptidase 
F. M2 peptidase angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, 
EC 3.4.15.1) catalyzes the conversion of decapeptide angiotensin 
I to the potent vasopressor octapeptide angiotensin II. 
ACE is a key part of the renin-angiotensin system that regulates 
blood pressure, thus ACE inhibitors are important for 
the treatment of hypertension. M32 family includes two eukaryotic 
enzymes from protozoa Trypanosoma cruzi, a causative 
agent of Chagas&apos; disease, and Leishmania major, a parasite 
that causes leishmaniasis, making them attractive targets 
for drug development. The M4 family includes secreted protease 
 thermolysin (EC 3.4.24.27), pseudolysin, aureolysin, neutral 
protease as well as fungalysin and bacillolysin (EC 3.4.24.28) 
that degrade extracellular proteins and peptides for 
bacterial nutrition, especially prior to sporulation. Thermolysin 
is widely used as a nonspecific protease to obtain 
fragments for peptide sequencing as well as in production of 
the artificial sweetener aspartame. M13 family includes neprilysin 
(EC 3.4.24.11) and endothelin-converting enzyme I (ECE-1, 
EC 3.4.24.71), which fulfill a broad range of physiological 
roles due to the greater variation in the S2&apos; subsite 
allowing substrate specificity and are prime therapeutic 
targets for selective inhibition. Peptidase M36 (fungamysin) 
family includes endopeptidases from pathogenic fungi. Fungalysin 
hydrolyzes extracellular matrix proteins such as elastin 
and keratin. Aspergillus fumigatus causes the pulmonary 
disease aspergillosis by invading the lungs of immuno-compromised 
animals and secreting fungalysin that possibly breaks 
down proteinaceous structural barriers

(vWA) domain was originally found in the blood coagulation 
protein von Willebrand factor (vWF). Typically, the vWA domain 
is made up of approximately 200 amino acid residues folded 
into a classic a/b para-rossmann type of fold. The vWA domain, 
since its discovery, has drawn great interest because of 
its widespread occurrence and its involvement in a wide variety 
of important cellular functions. These include basal membrane 
formation, cell migration, cell differentiation, adhesion, 
haemostasis, signaling, chromosomal stability, malignant 
transformation and in immune defenses  In integrins these 
domains form heterodimers while in vWF it forms multimers. 
There are different interaction surfaces of this domain as 
seen by the various molecules it complexes with. Ligand binding 
in most cases is mediated by the presence of a metal ion 
dependent adhesion site termed as the MIDAS motif that is a 
characteristic feature of most, if not all A domains.

Q#18 - YP_096809.1 [aminopeptidase [Legionella pneumophila subsp. pneumophila str. Philadelphia 1]]

>gnl|cdd|193500 M28_AAP(Specific), 193500, cd03879, M28 Zn-Peptidase Aeromonas 
(Vibrio) proteolytica aminopeptidase; Peptidase family M28; 
Aeromonas (Vibrio) proteolytica aminopeptidase (AAP; leucine 
aminopeptidase from Vibrio proteolyticus; Bacterial leucyl 
aminopeptidase; E.C. 3.4.11.10) subfamily. AAP is a small 
(32kDa), heat stable leucine aminopeptidase and is active as 
a monomer. Similar forms of the enzyme have been isolated from 
Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus thermophilus. Leucine 
aminopeptidases, in general, play important roles in many 
biological processes such as protein catabolism, hormone degradation, 
regulation of migration and cell proliferation, as 
well as HIV infection and proliferation. AAP is a broad-specificity 
enzyme, utilizing two zinc(II) ions in its active site 
to remove N-terminal amino acids, with preference for large 
hydrophobic amino acids in the P1 position of the substrate, 
Leu being the most efficiently cleaved. It can accommodate 
all residues, except Pro, Asp and Glu in the P1&apos; position.

Zinc_peptidase_like(Superfamily), 276098, cl14876, Zinc 
peptidases M18, M20, M28, and M42; Zinc peptidases play 
vital roles in metabolic and signaling pathways throughout all 
kingdoms of life. This family corresponds to several clans 
in the MEROPS database, including the MH clan, which contains 
4 families (M18, M20, M28, M42). The peptidase M20 family 
includes carboxypeptidases such as the glutamate carboxypeptidase 
from Pseudomonas, the thermostable carboxypeptidase 
Ss1 of broad specificity from archaea and yeast Gly-X carboxypeptidase. 
The dipeptidases include bacterial dipeptidase, 
peptidase V (PepV), a eukaryotic, non-specific dipeptidase, 
and two Xaa-His dipeptidases (carnosinases). There is also the 
bacterial aminopeptidase, peptidase T (PepT) that acts only 
on tripeptide substrates and has therefore been termed a 
tripeptidase. Peptidase family M28 contains aminopeptidases 
and carboxypeptidases, and has co-catalytic zinc ions. However, 
several enzymes in this family utilize other first row transition 
metal ions such as cobalt and manganese. Each zinc 
ion is tetrahedrally co-ordinated, with three amino acid ligands 
plus activated water; one aspartate residue binds both 
metal ions. The aminopeptidases in this family are also called 
bacterial leucyl aminopeptidases, but are able to release 
a variety of N-terminal amino acids. IAP aminopeptidase and 
aminopeptidase Y preferentially release basic amino acids 
while glutamate carboxypeptidase II preferentially releases 
C-terminal glutamates. Glutamate carbxypeptidase II and plasma 
glutamate carboxypeptidase hydrolyze dipeptides. Peptidase 
families M18 and M42 contain metalloaminopeptidases. M18 is 
widely distributed in bacteria and eukaryotes. However, only 
yeast aminopeptidase I and mammalian aspartyl aminopeptidase 
have been characterized in detail. Some of M42 (also known 
as glutamyl aminopeptidase) enzymes exhibit aminopeptidase 
specificity while others also have acylaminoacylpeptidase 
activity (i.e. hydrolysis of acylated N-terminal residues)

>gnl|cdd|258704 PTPlike_phytase(Specific), 258704, pfam14566, Inositol hexakisphosphate; 
Inositol hexakisphosphate, often called phytate, 
is found in abundance in seeds and acting as an inorganic phosphate 
reservoir. Phytases are phosphatases that hydrolyze 
phytate to less-phosphorylated myo-inositol derivatives and 
inorganic phosphate. The active-site sequence (HCXXGXGR) of 
the phytase identified from the gut micro-organism Selenomonas 
ruminantium forms a loop (P loop) at the base of a substrate 
binding pocket that is characteristic of protein tyrosine 
phosphatases (PTPs). The depth of this pocket is an important 
determinant of the substrate specificity of PTPs. In humans 
this enzyme is thought to aid bone mineralization and salvage 
the inositol moiety prior to apoptosis.
PTPc(Superfamily), 
271903, cl21483; Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP) catalyze 
the dephosphorylation of phosphotyrosine peptides; they 
regulate phosphotyrosine levels in signal transduction pathways.

This model describes the conserved core region of the beta subunit 
of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels in animals. 
Amino-terminal regions differ substantially, in part by alternative 
splicing, and are not included in the model. Four beta 
subunits form a complex with four alpha subunit cytoplasmic 
(T1) regions, and the structure of the complex is solved. 
The beta subunit belongs to a family of NAD(P)H-dependent aldo-keto 
reductases, binds NADPH, and couples voltage-gated 
channel activity to the redox potential of the cell. Plant beta 
subunits and their closely related bacterial homologs (in 
Deinococcus radiudurans, Xylella fastidiosa, etc.) appear 
more closely related to each other than to animal forms. However, 
the bacterial species lack convincing counterparts the 
Kv alpha subunit and the Kv beta homolog may serve as an enzyme. 
Cutoffs are set for this model such that yeast and plant 
forms and bacterial close homologs score between trusted 
and noise cutoffs

Q#26 - YP_096817.1 [virulence regulator BipA [Legionella pneumophila subsp. pneumophila str. Philadelphia 1]]

>gnl|cdd|206678 TypA_BipA(Specific), 206678, cd01891, Tyrosine phosphorylated 
protein A (TypA)/BipA family belongs to ribosome-binding GTPases; 
BipA is a protein belonging to the ribosome-binding family 
of GTPases and is widely distributed in bacteria and plants. 
BipA was originally described as a protein that is induced 
in Salmonella typhimurium after exposure to bactericidal/permeability-inducing 
protein (a cationic antimicrobial protein 
produced by neutrophils), and has since been identified 
in E. coli as well. The properties thus far described for 
BipA are related to its role in the process of pathogenesis 
by enteropathogenic E. coli. It appears to be involved in the 
regulation of several processes important for infection, 
including rearrangements of the cytoskeleton of the host, bacterial 
resistance to host defense peptides, flagellum-mediated 
cell motility, and expression of K5 capsular genes. It has 
been proposed that BipA may utilize a novel mechanism to 
regulate the expression of target genes. In addition, BipA from 
enteropathogenic E. coli has been shown to be phosphorylated 
on a tyrosine residue, while BipA from Salmonella and from 
E. coli K12 strains is not phosphorylated under the conditions 
assayed. The phosphorylation apparently modifies the 
rate of nucleotide hydrolysis, with the phosphorylated form 
showing greatly increased GTPase activity.

contain a signature motif, Q-loop, and H-loop/switch region, 
in addition to, the Walker A motif/P-loop and Walker B motif 
commonly found in a number of ATP- and GTP-binding and hydrolyzing

>gnl|cdd|239681 BipA_TypA_C(Specific), 239681, cd03710; BipA_TypA_C: a C-terminal 
portion of BipA or TypA having homology to the C terminal 
domains of the elongation factors EF-G and EF-2. A member 
of the ribosome binding GTPase superfamily, BipA is widely 
distributed in bacteria and plants.  BipA is a highly conserved 
protein with global regulatory properties in Escherichia 
coli. BipA is phosphorylated on a tyrosine residue under some 
cellular conditions. Mutants show altered regulation of some 
pathways. BipA functions as a translation factor that is 
required specifically for the expression of the transcriptional 
modulator Fis.  BipA binds to ribosomes at a site that 
coincides with that of EF-G and has a GTPase activity that is 
sensitive to high GDP:GTP ratios and, is stimulated  by 70S 
ribosomes programmed with mRNA and aminoacylated tRNAs. The 
growth rate-dependent induction of BipA allows the efficient 
expression of Fis, thereby modulating a range of downstream 
processes, including DNA metabolism and type III secretion.

Elongation_Factor_C(Superfamily), 261447, cl02785; Elongation 
factor G C-terminus. This domain includes the carboxyl 
terminal regions of elongation factors (EFs) bacterial EF-G, 
eukaryotic and archeal EF-2 and eukaryotic mitochondrial mtEFG1s 
and mtEFG2s. This group also includes proteins similar 
to the ribosomal protection proteins Tet(M) and Tet(O), BipA, 
LepA and, spliceosomal proteins: human 116kD U5 small nuclear 
ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) protein (U5-116 kD) and yeast 
counterpart Snu114p.  This domain adopts a ferredoxin-like 
fold consisting of an alpha-beta sandwich with anti-parallel 
beta-sheets, resembling the topology of domain III found in 
the elongation factors EF-G and eukaryotic EF-2, with which 
it forms the C-terminal block. The two domains however are 
not superimposable and domain III lacks some of the characteristics 
of this domain.  EF-2/EF-G in complex with GTP, promotes 
the translocation step of translation. During translocation 
the peptidyl-tRNA is moved from the A site to the P site, 
the uncharged tRNA from the P site to the E-site and, the 
mRNA is shifted one codon relative to the ribosome. Tet(M) 
and Tet(O) mediate Tc resistance. Typical Tcs bind to the ribosome 
and inhibit the elongation phase of protein synthesis, 
by inhibiting the occupation of site A by aminoacyl-tRNA. 
Tet(M) and Tet(O) catalyze the release of tetracycline (Tc) 
from the ribosome in a GTP-dependent manner.  BipA is a highly 
conserved protein with global regulatory properties in Escherichia 
coli. Yeast Snu114p is essential for cell viability 
and for splicing in vivo. Experiments suggest that GTP binding 
and probably GTP hydrolysis is important for the function 
of the U5-116 kD/Snu114p. The function of LepA proteins is 
unknown

contains an S1-like cold-shock domain (CSD) that is found in 
eukaryotes, prokaryotes, and archaea.  CSP&apos;s include the 
major cold-shock proteins CspA and CspB in bacteria and the 
eukaryotic gene regulatory factor Y-box protein. CSP expression 
is up-regulated by an abrupt drop in growth temperature. 
CSP&apos;s are also expressed under normal condition at 
lower level. The function of cold-shock proteins is not fully 
understood. They preferentially bind poly-pyrimidine region 
of single-stranded RNA and DNA.  CSP&apos;s are thought to 
bind mRNA and regulate ribosomal translation, mRNA degradation, 
and  the rate of transcription termination. The human Y-box 
protein, which contains a CSD, regulates transcription 
and translation of genes that contain the Y-box sequence in 
their promoters. This specific ssDNA-binding properties of CSD 
are required for the binding of Y-box protein to the promoter&apos;s 
Y-box sequence, thereby regulating transcription.

>gnl|cdd|132846 Pat_ExoU_VipD_like(Specific), 132846, cd07207, ExoU and VipD-like 
proteins; homologus to patatin, cPLA2, and iPLA2; ExoU, 
a 74-kDa enzyme, is a potent virulence factor of Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa. One of the pathogenic mechanisms of P. aeruginosa 
is to induce cytotoxicity by the injection of effector proteins 
(e.g. ExoU) using the type III secretion (T3S) system. 
ExoU is homologus to patatin and also has the conserved catalytic 
residues of mammalian calcium-independent (iPLA2) and 
cytosolic (cPLA2) PLA2. In vitro, ExoU cytotoxity is blocked 
by the inhibitor of cytosolic and Ca2-independent phospholipase 
A2 (cPLA2 and iPLA2) enzymes, suggesting that phospholipase 
A2 inhibitors may represent a novel mode of treatment 
for acute P. aeruginosa infections. ExoU requires eukaryotic 
superoxide dismutase as a cofactor and cleaves phosphatidylcholine 
and phosphatidylethanolamine in vitro. VipD, a 69-kDa 
cytosolic protein, belongs to the members of Legionella 
pneumophila family and is homologus to ExoU from Pseudomonas. 
Even though VipD shows high sequence similarity with several 
functional regions of ExoU (e.g. oxyanion hole, active site 
serine, active site aspartate), it has been shown to have 
no phospholipase activity. This family includes ExoU from Pseudomonas

of various patatin glycoproteins from plants. The patatin 
protein accounts for up to 40% of the total soluble protein 
in potato tubers. Patatin is a storage protein, but it also 
has the enzymatic activity of a lipid acyl hydrolase, catalyzing 
the cleavage of fatty acids from membrane lipids. Members 
of this family have also been found in vertebrates. This 
family also includes the catalytic domain of cytosolic phospholipase 
A2 (PLA2; EC 3.1.1.4) hydrolyzes the sn-2-acyl ester 
bond of phospholipids to release arachidonic acid. At the 
active site, cPLA2 contains a serine nucleophile through 
which the catalytic mechanism is initiated. The active site 
is partially covered by a solvent-accessible flexible lid. cPLA2 
displays interfacial activation as it exists in both &quot;closed 
lid&quot; and &quot;open lid&quot; forms

deacylate long-chain fatty acids by hydrolyzing acyl-CoA 
thioesters to free fatty acids and CoA-SH. Eukaryotic members 
of this family are expressed in brain, testis, and brown 
adipose tissues. The archeal and eukaryotic members of this 
family have two tandem copies of the conserved hot dog fold, 
while most bacterial members have only one copy.
hot_dog(Superfamily),

identified in the E. coli FabA (beta-hydroxydecanoyl-acyl

in 4HBT (4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase) from Pseudomonas. 
A number of other seemingly unrelated proteins also share 
the hotdog fold.  These proteins have related, but distinct, 
catalytic activities that include metabolic roles such as 
thioester hydrolysis in fatty acid metabolism, and degradation 
of phenylacetic acid and the environmental pollutant 4-chlorobenzoate. 
 This superfamily also includes the PaaI-like

 The glutaminase domain catalyzes amide nitrogen transfer from 
glutamine to the appropriate substrate. In this process, 
glutamine is hydrolyzed to glutamic acid and ammonia. In humans, 
GFAT catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step of hexosamine 
metabolism, the conversion of D-fructose-6P (Fru6P) 
into D-glucosamine-6P using L-glutamine as a nitrogen source. 
 The end product of this pathway, UDP-N-acetyl glucosamine,

as glucosamine-fructose 6-phosphate synthase (GLMS or GFAT), 
glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (Prpp) amidotransferase 
(GPATase), asparagine synthetase B (AsnB), beta lactam synthetase 
(beta-LS) and glutamate synthase (GltS). GLMS catalyzes 
the formation of glucosamine 6-phosphate from fructose

catalyzes the first step in purine biosynthesis, an amide transfer 
from glutamine to PRPP, resulting in phosphoribosylamine, 
pyrophosphate and glutamate.  Asparagine synthetase B  
synthesizes asparagine from aspartate and glutamine. Beta-LS 
catalyzes the formation of the beta-lactam ring in the beta-lactamase 
inhibitor clavulanic acid. GltS synthesizes L-glutamate

domain repeat 2 found in Glucosamine 6-phosphate synthase 
(GlmS) and Glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase (GlmD). The 
SIS domain is found in many phosphosugar isomerases and phosphosugar 
binding proteins. GlmS contains a N-terminal glutaminase 
domain and two C-terminal SIS domains and catalyzes the 
first step in hexosamine metabolism, converting fructose 6-phosphate 
into glucosamine 6-phosphate using glutamine as nitrogen 
source. The glutaminase domain hydrolyzes glutamine 
to glutamate and ammonia. Ammonia is transferred through a channel 
to the isomerase domain for glucosamine 6-phosphate synthesis. 
The end product of the pathway is N-acetylglucosamine, 
which plays multiple roles in eukaryotic cells including 
being a building block of bacterial and fungal cell walls. 
In the absence of glutamine, GlmS catalyzes the isomerization 
of fructose 6-phosphate into glucose 6- phosphate (PGI-like 
activity). Glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase (GlmD) contains 
two SIS domains and catalyzes the deamination and isomerization 
of glucosamine-6-phosphate into fructose-6-phosphate 
with the release of ammonia; in presence of high ammonia concentration, 
GlmD can catalyze the reverse reaction.

>gnl|cdd|239315 PRX_BCP(Specific), 239315, cd03017; Peroxiredoxin (PRX) family, 
Bacterioferritin comigratory protein (BCP) subfamily; composed 
of  thioredoxin-dependent thiol peroxidases, widely expressed 
in pathogenic bacteria, that protect cells against toxicity 
from reactive oxygen species by reducing and detoxifying 
hydroperoxides. The protein was named BCP based on its 
electrophoretic mobility before its function was known. BCP 
shows substrate selectivity toward fatty acid hydroperoxides 
rather than hydrogen peroxide or alkyl hydroperoxides. BCP 
contains the peroxidatic cysteine but appears not to possess 
a resolving cysteine (some sequences, not all, contain a second 
cysteine but its role is still unknown). Unlike other PRXs, 
BCP exists as a monomer. The plant homolog of BCP is PRX 
Q, which is expressed only in leaves and is cellularly localized 
in the chloroplasts and the guard cells of stomata. Also 
included in this subfamily is the fungal nuclear protein, 
 Dot5p (for disrupter of telomere silencing protein 5), which 
functions as an alkyl-hydroperoxide reductase during post-diauxic 
growth.

Protein Disulfide Oxidoreductases and Other Proteins with 
a Thioredoxin fold; The thioredoxin (TRX)-like superfamily 
is a large, diverse group of proteins containing a TRX fold. 
Many members contain a classic TRX domain with a redox active 
CXXC motif. They function as protein disulfide oxidoreductases 
(PDOs), altering the redox state of target proteins

Q#45 - YP_096836.1 [major facilitator transporter [Legionella pneumophila subsp. pneumophila str. Philadelphia 1]]

>gnl|cdd|119392 MFS(Specific), 119392, cd06174; The Major Facilitator Superfamily 
(MFS) is a large and diverse group of secondary transporters 
that includes uniporters, symporters, and antiporters. 
MFS proteins facilitate the transport across cytoplasmic or 
internal membranes of a variety of substrates including ions, 
sugar phosphates, drugs, neurotransmitters, nucleosides, 
amino acids, and peptides. They do so using the electrochemical 
potential of the transported substrates. Uniporters transport 
a single substrate, while symporters and antiporters transport 
two substrates in the same or in opposite directions, 
respectively, across membranes. MFS proteins are typically 
400 to 600 amino acids in length, and the majority contain 
12 transmembrane alpha helices (TMs) connected by hydrophilic 
loops. The N- and C-terminal halves of these proteins display 
weak similarity and may be the result of a gene duplication/fusion 
event. Based on kinetic studies and the structures 
of a few bacterial superfamily members, GlpT (glycerol-3-phosphate 
transporter), LacY (lactose permease), and EmrD (multidrug 
transporter), MFS proteins are thought to function 
through a single substrate binding site, alternating-access 
mechanism involving a rocker-switch type of movement. Bacterial 
members function primarily for nutrient uptake, and as drug-efflux 
pumps to confer antibiotic resistance. Some MFS proteins 
have medical significance in humans such as the glucose 
transporter Glut4, which is impaired in type II diabetes, 
and glucose-6-phosphate transporter (G6PT), which causes glycogen 
storage disease when mutated.

Q#46 - YP_096837.1 [PhoH protein (phosphate starvation inducible protein) [Legionella pneumophila subsp. pneumophila str. Philadelphia 1]]

>gnl|cdd|189053 PIN_PhoHL-ATPase(Specific), 189053, cd09883, PIN domain of bacterial 
Smg6-like homologs with PhoH-like ATPase domains; PIN 
(PilT N terminus) domain of Smg6-like bacterial proteins with 
C-terminal PhoH-like ATPase domains and other similar homologs 
are included in this family. Eukaryotic Smg5 and Smg6 
nucleases are essential factors in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay 
(NMD), a post-transcriptional regulatory pathway that recognizes 
and rapidly degrades mRNAs containing premature translation 
termination codons. In vivo, the Smg6 PIN domain elicits 
degradation of bound mRNAs, as well as, metal ion dependent, 
degradation of single-stranded RNA, in vitro. These 
PIN domains are homologs of flap endonuclease-1 (FEN1)-like 
PIN domains, but lack the extensive arch/clamp region  and the 
H3TH (helix-3-turn-helix) domain, an atypical helix-hairpin-helix-2-like 
region, seen in FEN1-like PIN domains.  PIN 
domains within this subgroup contain four highly conserved acidic 
residues (putative metal-binding, active site residues). 
Many of the bacterial homologs in this group have an N-terminal 
PIN domain and a C-terminal PhoH-like ATPase domain and 
are predicted to be ATPases which are induced by phosphate 
starvation.
PIN_SF(Superfamily), 276064, cl14812, PIN (PilT 
N terminus) domain: Superfamily; PIN_SF The PIN (PilT N terminus) 
domain belongs to a large nuclease superfamily with 
representatives from eukaryota, eubacteria, and archaea. PIN 
domains were originally named for their sequence similarity 
to the N-terminal domain of an annotated pili biogenesis protein, 
PilT, a domain fusion between a PIN-domain and a PilT 
ATPase domain.  The structural properties of the PIN domain 
indicate its putative active center, consisting of invariant 
acidic amino acid residues (putative metal-binding residues) 
is geometrically similar in the active center of structure-specific 
5&apos; nucleases (also known as Flap endonuclease-1-like), 
PIN-domain ribonucleases of eukaryotic rRNA editing 
proteins, and bacterial toxins of toxin-antitoxin (TA) operons. 
Seen here, are two major divisions in the PIN domain 
superfamily. The first major division, the structure-specific 
5&apos; nuclease family, is represented by FEN1, the 5&apos;-3&apos; 
exonuclease of DNA polymerase I, and T4 RNase H nuclease 
PIN domains. These 5&apos; nucleases are involved in 
DNA replication, repair, and recombination. They are capable 
of both 5&apos;-3&apos; exonucleolytic activity and cleaving 
bifurcated DNA, in an endonucleolytic, structure-specific 
manner. Unique to FEN1-like nucleases, the PIN domain has a 
helical arch/clamp region (I domain) of variable length (approximately 
16 to 800 residues) and, inserted within the C-terminal 
region of the PIN domain, a H3TH (helix-3-turn-helix) 
domain, an atypical helix-hairpin-helix-2-like region. Both 
the H3TH domain (not included here) and the helical arch/clamp 
region are involved in DNA binding. With the exception 
of Mkt1, these nucleases have a carboxylate rich active site 
that is involved in binding essential divalent metal ion cofactors 
(Mg2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, or Co2+).  The second major division 
of the PIN domain superfamily, the VapC-Smg6 family, includes 
such eukaryotic ribonucleases as, Smg6, an essential factor 
in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay; Rrp44, the catalytic 
subunit of the exosome; and Nob1, a ribosome assembly factor 
critical in pre-rRNA processing. A large percentage of members 
in this family are bacterial ribonuclease toxins of TA operons 
such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis VapC and Neisseria 
gonorrhoeae FitB, as well as, archaeal homologs, Pyrobaculum 
aerophilum Pea0151 and P. aerophilum Pae2754. Also included 
are the eukaryotic Fcf1/ Utp24 (FAF1-copurifying factor 1/U 
three-associated protein 24) and Utp23-like proteins.  Components 
of the small subunit processome, Fcf1/Utp24 and Utp23 
are essential proteins involved in pre-rRNA processing and 
40S ribosomal subunit assembly

(DUF2807); This bacterial family of proteins shows structural 
similarity to other pectin lyase families. Although structures 
from this family align with acetyl-transferases, there

that the function is one of cell-adhesion. In PDB:3jx8, 
it is interesting to note that the sequence of contains several 
well defined sequence repeats, centred around GSG motifs 
defining the tight beta turn between the two sheets of the 
super-helix; there are 8 such repeats in the C-terminal half 
of the protein, which could be grouped into 4 repeats of 
two. It seems likely that this family belongs to the superfamily 
of trimeric autotransporter adhesins (TAAs), which are 
important virulence factors in Gram-negative pathogens. In the 
case of Parabacteroides distasonis, which is a cmoponent 
of the normal distal human gut microbiota, TAA-like complexes 
probably modulate adherence to the host (information derived 
from TOPSAN)

understood. They preferentially bind poly-pyrimidine region 
of single-stranded RNA and DNA.  CSP&apos;s are thought to

and  the rate of transcription termination. The human Y-box 
protein, which contains a CSD, regulates transcription 
and translation of genes that contain the Y-box sequence in

domain; NAD(P)-binding Rossmann-like domain.  
SDR(Superfamily), 
276298, cl21454, Short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases 
(SDR); SDRs are a functionally diverse family of 
oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally 
conserved Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with 
a central beta-sheet), an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally 
diverse C-terminal region. Classical SDRs are typically 
about 250 residues long, while extended SDRs are approximately 
350 residues. Sequence identity between different 
SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes 
share the Rossmann fold NAD-binding motif and characteristic 
NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns. These enzymes 
catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism 
of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic 
compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical 
SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK 
active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site 
motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human 
prostaglandin dehydrogenase (PGDH) numbering). In addition 
to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, 
PGDH numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, PGDH numbering) 
contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is 
in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The 
standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and 
proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water 
molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Extended SDRs 
have additional elements in the C-terminal region, and typically 
have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. Complex (multidomain) 
SDRs such as ketoreductase (KR) domains of fatty acid 
synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered 
active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type KRs have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G 
NAD(P)-binding motif. Some atypical SDRs have lost catalytic 
activity and/or have an unusual NAD(P)-binding motif 
and missing or unusual active site residues. Reactions catalyzed 
within the SDR family include isomerization, decarboxylation, 
epimerization, C=N bond reduction, dehydratase activity, 
dehalogenation, Enoyl-CoA reduction, and carbonyl-alcohol 
oxidoreduction

>gnl|cdd|223232 GatA(Specific), 223232, COG0154; Asp-tRNAAsn/Glu-tRNAGln amidotransferase 
A subunit and related amidases [Translation, ribosomal 
structure and biogenesis]
GGCT_like(Superfamily), 276218, 
cl18951; GGCT-like domains, also called AIG2-like family. 
Gamma-glutamyl cyclotransferase (GGCT) catalyzes the formation 
of pyroglutamic acid (5-oxoproline) from dipeptides containing 
gamma-glutamyl, and is a dimeric protein. In Homo 
sapiens, the protein is encoded by the gene C7orf24, and the 
enzyme participates in the gamma-glutamyl cycle. Hereditary 
defects in the gamma-glutamyl cycle have been described for 
some of the genes involved, but not for C7orf24. The synthesis 
and metabolism of glutathione (L-gamma-glutamyl-L-cysteinylglycine) 
ties the gamma-glutamyl cycle to numerous cellular 
processes; glutathione acts as a ubiquitous reducing agent 
in reductive mechanisms involved in protein and DNA synthesis, 
transport processes, enzyme activity, and metabolism. AIG2 
(avrRpt2-induced gene) is an Arabidopsis protein that exhibits 
RPS2- and avrRpt2-dependent induction early after infection 
with Pseudomonas syringae pv maculicola strain ES4326 
carrying avrRpt2. avrRpt2 is an avirulence gene that can convert 
virulent strains of P. syringae to avirulence on Arabidopsis 
thaliana, soybean, and bean. The family also includes 
bacterial tellurite-resistance proteins (trgB); tellurium (Te) 
compounds are used in industrial processes and had been 
used as antimicrobial agents in the past. Some members have 
been described proteins involved in cation transport (chaC)

A (vWA) domain was originally found in the blood coagulation 
protein von Willebrand factor (vWF). Typically, the vWA domain 
is made up of approximately 200 amino acid residues folded 
into a classic a/b para-rossmann type of fold. The vWA 
domain, since its discovery, has drawn great interest because 
of its widespread occurrence and its involvement in a wide 
variety of important cellular functions. These include basal 
membrane formation, cell migration, cell differentiation, 
adhesion, haemostasis, signaling, chromosomal stability, malignant 
transformation and in immune defenses  In integrins these 
domains form heterodimers while in vWF it forms multimers. 
There are different interaction surfaces of this domain 
as seen by the various molecules it complexes with. Ligand binding 
in most cases is mediated by the presence of a metal 
ion dependent adhesion site termed as the MIDAS motif that is 
a characteristic feature of most, if not all A domains

>gnl|cdd|239200 DUS_like_FMN(Specific), 239200, cd02801; Dihydrouridine synthase-like 
(DUS-like) FMN-binding domain. Members of this family 
catalyze the reduction of the 5,6-double bond of a uridine 
residue on tRNA. Dihydrouridine modification of tRNA is widely 
observed in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and also in some 
archaea. Most dihydrouridines are found in the D loop of t-RNAs. 
The role of dihydrouridine in tRNA is currently unknown, 
but may increase conformational flexibility of the tRNA. 
It is likely that different family members have different substrate 
specificities, which may overlap. 1VHN, a putative 
flavin oxidoreductase, has high sequence similarity to DUS. 
 The enzymatic mechanism of 1VHN is not known at the present.

>gnl|cdd|276298 SDR(Superfamily), 276298, cl21454, Short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases 
(SDR); SDRs are a functionally diverse family of 
oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally 
conserved Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with 
a central beta-sheet), an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally 
diverse C-terminal region. Classical SDRs are typically 
about 250 residues long, while extended SDRs are approximately 
350 residues. Sequence identity between different 
SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes 
share the Rossmann fold NAD-binding motif and characteristic 
NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns. These enzymes 
catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism 
of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic 
compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical 
SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK 
active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site 
motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human 
prostaglandin dehydrogenase (PGDH) numbering). In addition 
to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, 
PGDH numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, PGDH numbering) 
contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is 
in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The 
standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and 
proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water 
molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Extended SDRs 
have additional elements in the C-terminal region, and typically 
have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. Complex (multidomain) 
SDRs such as ketoreductase (KR) domains of fatty acid 
synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered 
active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type KRs have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G 
NAD(P)-binding motif. Some atypical SDRs have lost catalytic 
activity and/or have an unusual NAD(P)-binding motif 
and missing or unusual active site residues. Reactions catalyzed 
within the SDR family include isomerization, decarboxylation, 
epimerization, C=N bond reduction, dehydratase activity, 
dehalogenation, Enoyl-CoA reduction, and carbonyl-alcohol 
oxidoreduction

AdoMet-MTase), class I;  AdoMet-MTases are enzymes that use 
S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM or AdoMet) as a substrate for 
methyltransfer, creating the product S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine 
(AdoHcy). There are at least five structurally distinct 
families of AdoMet-MTases, class I being the largest and most 
diverse. Within this class enzymes can be classified by different 
substrate specificities (small molecules, lipids, nucleic 
acids, etc.) and different target atoms for methylation 
(nitrogen, oxygen, carbon, sulfur, etc.)

Q#68 - YP_096859.1 [6-pyruvoyl tetrahydrobiopterin synthase [Legionella pneumophila subsp. pneumophila str. Philadelphia 1]]

>gnl|cdd|275505 TFold(Superfamily), 275505, cl00263; Tunnelling fold (T-fold). 
The five known T-folds are found in five different enzymes 
with different functions: dihydroneopterin-triphosphate epimerase 
(DHNTPE), dihydroneopterin aldolase (DHNA) , GTP cyclohydrolase 
I (GTPCH-1),  6-pyrovoyl tetrahydropterin synthetase 
(PTPS), and uricase (UO,uroate/urate oxidase). They bind 
to substrates belonging to the purine or pterin families, and 
share a fold-related binding site with a glutamate or glutamine 
residue anchoring the substrate and a lot of conserved 
interactions. They also share a similar oligomerization mode: 
several T-folds join together to form a beta(2n)alpha(n) 
barrel, then two barrels join together in a head-to-head fashion 
to made up the native enzymes. The functional enzyme is 
a tetramer for UO, a hexamer for PTPS, an octamer for DHNA/DHNTPE 
and a decamer for GTPCH-1. The substrate is located 
in a deep and narrow pocket at the interface between monomers. 
In PTPS, the active site is located at the interface of three 
monomers, two from one trimer and one from the other trimer. 
In GTPCH-1, it is also located at the interface of three 
subunits, two from one pentamer and one from the other pentamer. 
There are four equivalent active sites in UO, six in 
PTPS, eight in DHNA/DHNTPE and ten in GTPCH-1.   Each globular 
multimeric enzyme encloses a tunnel which is lined with 
charged residues for DHNA and UO, and with basic residues in 
PTPS. The N and C-terminal ends are located on one side of 
the T-fold while the residues involved in the catalytic activity 
are located at the opposite side. In PTPS, UO and DHNA/DHNTPE, 
the N and C-terminal extremities of the enzyme are located 
on the exterior side of the functional multimeric enzyme. 
In GTPCH-1, the extra C-terminal helix places the extremity 
inside the tunnel

nucleotides. Both enzymes are involved in the biosynthesis 
of DNA precursors and are active as homodimers. However, 
they exhibit distinct pyrimidine base specificities and differ 
in the details of their catalyzed reactions. TS is biologically 
ubiquitous and catalyzes the conversion of dUMP and 
methylene-tetrahydrofolate (CH2THF) to dTMP and dihydrofolate 
(DHF). It also acts as a regulator of its own expression by 
binding and inactivating its own RNA. Due to its key role 
in the de novo pathway for thymidylate synthesis and, hence, 
DNA synthesis, it is one of the most conserved enzymes across 
species and phyla. TS is a well-recognized target for anticancer 
chemotherapy, as well as a valuable new target against 
infectious diseases. Interestingly, in several protozoa, 
a single polypeptide chain codes for both, dihydrofolate reductase

Q#75 - YP_096866.1 [dinucleoside polyphosphate hydrolase [Legionella pneumophila subsp. pneumophila str. Philadelphia 1]]

>gnl|cdd|239643 Ap4A_hydrolase_plant_like(Specific), 239643, cd03671; Diadenosine 
tetraphosphate (Ap4A) hydrolase is a member of the Nudix 
hydrolase superfamily. Members of this family are well represented 
in a variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. 
Phylogenetic analysis reveals two distinct subgroups where 
plant enzymes fall into one group (represented by this subfamily) 
and fungi/animals/archaea enzymes fall into another. 
Bacterial enzymes are found in both subfamilies. Ap4A is a 
potential by-product of aminoacyl tRNA synthesis, and accumulation 
of Ap4A has been implicated in a range of biological 
events, such as DNA replication, cellular differentiation, heat 
shock, metabolic stress, and apoptosis. Ap4A hydrolase cleaves 
Ap4A asymmetrically into ATP and AMP. It is important 
in the invasive properties of bacteria and thus presents a 
potential target for the inhibition of such invasive bacteria. 
Besides the signature nudix motif (G[X5]E[X7]REUXEEXGU where 
U is Ile, Leu, or Val), Ap4A hydrolase is structurally similar 
to the other members of the nudix superfamily with some 
degree of variations. Several regions in the sequences are 
poorly defined and substrate and metal binding sites are only 
predicted based on kinetic studies.
Nudix_Hydrolase(Superfamily), 
275580, cl00447; Nudix hydrolase is a superfamily 
of enzymes found in all three kingdoms of life, and it catalyzes 
the hydrolysis of NUcleoside DIphosphates linked to other 
moieties, X. Enzymes belonging to this superfamily require 
a divalent cation, such as Mg2+ or Mn2+ for their activity. 
Members of this family are recognized by a highly conserved 
23-residue nudix motif (GX5EX7REUXEEXGU, where U = I, L or 
V), which forms a structural motif that functions as a metal 
binding and catalytic site. Substrates of nudix hydrolase 
include intact and oxidatively damaged nucleoside triphosphates, 
dinucleoside polyphosphates, nucleotide-sugars and dinucleotide 
enzymes. These substrates are metabolites or cell signaling 
molecules that require regulation during different 
stages of the cell cycle or during periods of stress. In general, 
the role of the nudix hydrolase is to sanitize the nucleotide 
pools and to maintain cell viability, thereby serving 
as surveillance and &quot;house-cleaning&quot; enzymes. Substrate 
specificity is used to define child families within 
the superfamily. Differences in substrate specificity are determined 
by the N-terminal extension or by residues in variable 
loop regions. Mechanistically, substrate hydrolysis occurs 
by a nucleophilic substitution reaction, with variation in 
the numbers and roles of divalent cations required. This superfamily 
consists of at least nine families: IPP (isopentenyl 
diphosphate) isomerase, ADP ribose pyrophosphatase, mutT 
pyrophosphohydrolase, coenzyme-A pyrophosphatase, MTH1-7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine-triphosphatase, 
diadenosine tetraphosphate 
hydrolase, NADH pyrophosphatase, GDP-mannose hydrolase and 
the c-terminal portion of the mutY adenine glycosylase

bacterial L-asparaginase; Asparaginases (amidohydrolases, 
E.C. 3.5.1.1) are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of asparagine 
to aspartic acid and ammonia. In bacteria, there are 
two classes of amidohydrolases. This model represents type 
I L-asparaginases, which are highly specific for asparagine 
and localized in the cytosol. Type I L-asparaginase acts as 
a dimer. A conserved threonine residue is thought to supply 
the nucleophile hydroxy-group that attacks the amide bond. 
Many bacterial L-asparaginases have both L-asparagine and L-glutamine 
hydrolysis activities, to a different degree, and 
some of them are annotated as asparaginase/glutaminase. One 
example of an enzyme with no L-glutaminase activity is the 
type I L-asparaginase from Wolinella succinogenes.

bond. Many bacterial L-asparaginases have both L-asparagine 
and L-glutamine hydrolysis activities, to a different degree, 
and some of them are annotated as asparaginase/glutaminase. 
This wider family also includes a subunit of an archaeal Glu-tRNA

of bacterial GlmU; The N-terminal domain of N-Acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate 
uridyltransferase (GlmU). GlmU is an essential 
bacterial enzyme with both an acetyltransferase and an uridyltransferase 
activity which have been mapped to the C-terminal 
and N-terminal domains, respectively. This family represents 
the N-terminal uridyltransferase. GlmU performs the last 
two steps in the synthesis of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), 
which is an essential precursor in both the peptidoglycan 
and the lipopolysaccharide metabolic pathways in Gram-positive 
and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively.

275925, cl11394, Glycosyltransferase 
family A (GT-A) includes diverse families of glycosyl 
transferases with a common GT-A type structural fold; Glycosyltransferases 
(GTs) are enzymes that synthesize oligosaccharides, 
polysaccharides, and glycoconjugates by transferring 
the sugar moiety from an activated nucleotide-sugar donor to 
an acceptor molecule, which may be a growing oligosaccharide, 
a lipid, or a protein.  Based on the stereochemistry of 
the donor and acceptor molecules, GTs are classified as either 
retaining or inverting enzymes. To date, all GT structures 
adopt one of two possible folds, termed GT-A fold and GT-B 
fold.  This hierarchy includes diverse families of glycosyl 
transferases with a common GT-A type structural fold, which 
has two tightly associated beta/alpha/beta domains that tend 
to form a continuous central sheet of at least eight beta-strands. 
The majority of the proteins in this superfamily are 
Glycosyltransferase family 2 (GT-2) proteins. But it also 
includes families GT-43, GT-6, GT-8, GT13 and GT-7; which are 
evolutionarily related to GT-2 and share structure similarities

uridyltransferase (GlmU), C-terminal left-handed 
beta-helix (LbH) acetyltransferase domain: GlmU is also known 
as UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase. It is a bifunctional 
bacterial enzyme that catalyzes two consecutive steps 
in the formation of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), 
an important precursor in bacterial cell wall formation. The 
two enzymatic activities, uridyltransferase and acetyltransferase, 
are carried out by two independent domains. The C-terminal 
LbH domain possesses the acetyltransferase activity. 
It catalyzes the CoA-dependent acetylation of GlcN-1-phosphate 
to GlcNAc-1-phosphate. The LbH domain contains 10 turns, 
each containing three imperfect tandem repeats of a hexapeptide 
repeat motif (X-[STAV]-X-[LIV]-[GAED]-X. The acetyltransferase 
active site is located at the interface between two 
subunits of the active LbH trimer.

are often enzymes showing acyltransferase activity, however, 
some subfamilies in this hierarchy also show activities 
related to ion transport or translation initiation. Many 
are trimeric in their active forms

subfamily are found in all three kingdoms of life. It is functionally 
diverse subfamily, in addition to the CorA Co2+ 
transporter from the hyperthermophilic Thermotoga maritima, 
it includes Methanosarcina mazei CorA which may be involved 
in transport of copper and/or other divalent metal ions. Thermotoga 
maritima CorA forms funnel-shaped homopentamers, the 
tip of the funnel is formed from two C-terminal transmembrane 
(TM) helices from each monomer, and the large opening of 
the funnel from the N-terminal cytoplasmic domains. The GMN 
signature motif of the MIT superfamily occurs just after TM1, 
mutation within this motif is known to abolish Mg2+ transport 
by a related protein, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Alr1p. Natural 
variants in this signature sequence may be associated 
with the transport of different divalent cations. The functional 
diversity of the MIT superfamily may also be due to minor 
structural differences regulating gating, substrate selection,

of Arabidopsis thaliana members (AtMGTs), some of which 
are localized to distinct tissues, and not all of which can 
transport Mg2+. Thermotoga maritima CorA and Vibrio parahaemolyticus 
and Salmonella typhimurium ZntB form funnel-shaped 
homopentamers, the tip of the funnel is formed from two C-terminal 
transmembrane (TM) helices from each monomer, and the 
large opening of the funnel from the N-terminal cytoplasmic 
domains. The GMN signature motif of the MIT superfamily occurs 
just after TM1, mutation within this motif is known to 
abolish Mg2+ transport through Salmonella typhimurium CorA, 
Mrs2p, and Alr1p. Natural variants such as GVN and GIN, as in 
some ZntB family proteins, may be associated with the transport 
of different divalent cations, such as zinc and cadmium. 
The functional diversity of MIT transporters may also be 
due to minor structural differences regulating gating, substrate 
selection, and transport

>gnl|cdd|250695 CorA(Multidom), 250695, pfam01544, CorA-like Mg2+ transporter 
protein; The CorA transport system is the primary Mg2+ influx 
system of Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli. CorA 
is virtually ubiquitous in the Bacteria and Archaea. There 
are also eukaryotic relatives of this protein. The family 
includes the MRS2 protein from yeast that is thought to be an 
RNA splicing protein. However its membership of this family 
suggests that its effect on splicing is due to altered magnesium 
levels in the cell
