The ASCE division also includes ABC, RecA-like, VirD4-like, PilT-like, and SF1/2 helicases. Members of the AAA+ ATPases function as molecular chaperons, ATPase subunits of proteases, helicases, or nucleic-acid stimulated ATPases. The AAA+ proteins contain several distinct features in addition to the conserved alpha-beta-alpha core domain structure and the Walker A and B motifs of the P-loop NTPases.

FtsH is the only membrane-bound ATP-dependent protease universally conserved in prokaryotes. It only efficiently degrades proteins that have a low thermodynamic stability - e.g. it lacks robust unfoldase activity. This feature may be key and implies that this could be a criterion for degrading a protein. In Oenococcus oeni FtsH is involved in protection against environmental stress, and shows increased expression under heat or osmotic stress. These two lines of evidence suggest that it is a fundamental prokaryotic self-protection mechanism that checks if proteins are correctly folded (personal obs: Yeats C). The precise function of this N-terminal region is unclear.

Shikimate pathway links metabolism of carbohydrates to de novo biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids, quinones and folate. It is essential in plants, bacteria, and fungi but absent in mammals, thus making enzymes involved in this pathway ideal targets for broad spectrum antibiotics and herbicides. Shikimate DH catalyzes the reduction of 3-hydroshikimate to shikimate using the cofactor NADH. Amino acid DH-like NAD(P)-binding domains are members of the Rossmann fold superfamily and include glutamate, leucine, and phenylalanine DHs, methylene tetrahydrofolate DH, methylene-tetrahydromethanopterin DH, methylene-tetrahydropholate DH/cyclohydrolase, Shikimate DH-like proteins, malate oxidoreductases, and glutamyl tRNA reductase. Amino acid DHs catalyze the deamination of amino acids to keto acids with NAD(P)+ as a cofactor. The NAD(P)-binding Rossmann fold superfamily includes a wide variety of protein families including NAD(P)- binding domains of alcohol DHs, tyrosine-dependent oxidoreductases, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate DH, lactate/malate DHs, formate/glycerate DHs, siroheme synthases, 6-phosphogluconate DHs, amino acid DHs, repressor rex, NAD-binding potassium channel  domain, CoA-binding, and ornithine cyclodeaminase-like domains. These domains have an alpha-beta-alpha configuration. NAD binding involves numerous hydrogen and van der Waals contacts.

Classical SDRs are typically about 250 residues long, while extended SDRs are approximately 350 residues. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold NAD-binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns. These enzymes catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human prostaglandin dehydrogenase (PGDH) numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, PGDH numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, PGDH numbering) contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Extended SDRs have additional elements in the C-terminal region, and typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase (KR) domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type KRs have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif. Some atypical SDRs have lost catalytic activity and/or have an unusual NAD(P)-binding motif and missing or unusual active site residues. Reactions catalyzed within the SDR family include isomerization, decarboxylation, epimerization, C=N bond reduction, dehydratase activity, dehalogenation, Enoyl-CoA reduction, and carbonyl-alcohol oxidoreduction.

It includes bacterial-type alanyl aminopeptidases as well as PfA-M1 aminopeptidase (Plasmodium falciparum-type). APN consists of a small N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a single transmembrane domain and a large extracellular ectodomain that contains the active site. It preferentially cleaves neutral amino acids from the N-terminus of oligopeptides and, in higher eukaryotes, is present in a variety of human tissues and cell types (leukocyte, fibroblast, endothelial and epithelial cells). APN expression is dysregulated in inflammatory diseases such as chronic pain, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyositis/dermatomyosytis and pulmonary sarcoidosis, and is enhanced in tumor cells such as melanoma, renal, prostate, pancreas, colon, gastric and thyroid cancers. It is predominantly expressed on stem cells and on cells of the granulocytic and monocytic lineages at distinct stages of differentiation, thus considered a marker of differentiation. Thus, APN inhibition may lead to the development of anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory drugs. APNs are also present in many pathogenic bacteria and represent potential drug targets, Some APNs have been used commercially, such as one from Lactococcus lactis used in the food industry. APN also serves as a receptor for coronaviruses, although the virus receptor interaction site seems to be distinct from the enzymatic site and aminopeptidase activity is not necessary for viral infection. APNs have also been extensively studied as putative Cry toxin receptors. Cry1 proteins are pore-forming toxins that bind to the midgut epithelial cell membrane of susceptible insect larvae, causing extensive damage. Several different toxins, including Cry1Aa, Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac, Cry1Ba, Cry1Ca and Cry1Fa, have been shown to bind to APNs; however, a direct role of APN in cytotoxicity has been yet to be firmly established.

All peptidases in this family bind a single catalytic zinc ion which is tetrahedrally co-ordinated by three amino acid ligands and a water molecule that forms the nucleophile on activation during catalysis. M1 family includes aminopeptidase N (APN) and leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H).  APN preferentially cleaves neutral amino acids from the N-terminus of oligopeptides and is present in a variety of human tissues and cell types. LTA4H is a bifunctional enzyme, possessing an aminopeptidase as well as an epoxide hydrolase activity such that the two activities occupy different, but overlapping sites. The peptidase M3 or neurolysin-like family, includes M3, M2 and M32 metallopeptidases.  The M3 peptidases have two subfamilies: M3A, includes thimet oligopeptidase (TOP; endopeptidase 3.4.24.15), neurolysin (3.4.24.16), and the mitochondrial intermediate peptidase; M3B contains oligopeptidase F. M2 peptidase angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, EC 3.4.15.1) catalyzes the conversion of decapeptide angiotensin I to the potent vasopressor octapeptide angiotensin II. ACE is a key part of the renin-angiotensin system that regulates blood pressure, thus ACE inhibitors are important for the treatment of hypertension. M32 family includes two eukaryotic enzymes from protozoa Trypanosoma cruzi, a causative agent of Chagas&apos; disease, and Leishmania major, a parasite that causes leishmaniasis, making them attractive targets for drug development. The M4 family includes secreted protease  thermolysin (EC 3.4.24.27), pseudolysin, aureolysin, neutral protease as well as fungalysin and bacillolysin (EC 3.4.24.28) that degrade extracellular proteins and peptides for bacterial nutrition, especially prior to sporulation. Thermolysin is widely used as a nonspecific protease to obtain fragments for peptide sequencing as well as in production of the artificial sweetener aspartame. M13 family includes neprilysin (EC 3.4.24.11) and endothelin-converting enzyme I (ECE-1, EC 3.4.24.71), which fulfill a broad range of physiological roles due to the greater variation in the S2&apos; subsite allowing substrate specificity and are prime therapeutic targets for selective inhibition. Peptidase M36 (fungamysin) family includes endopeptidases from pathogenic fungi. Fungalysin hydrolyzes extracellular matrix proteins such as elastin and keratin. Aspergillus fumigatus causes the pulmonary disease aspergillosis by invading the lungs of immuno-compromised animals and secreting fungalysin that possibly breaks down proteinaceous structural barriers.

AAP is a small (32kDa), heat stable leucine aminopeptidase and is active as a monomer. Similar forms of the enzyme have been isolated from Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus thermophilus. Leucine aminopeptidases, in general, play important roles in many biological processes such as protein catabolism, hormone degradation, regulation of migration and cell proliferation, as well as HIV infection and proliferation. AAP is a broad-specificity enzyme, utilizing two zinc(II) ions in its active site to remove N-terminal amino acids, with preference for large hydrophobic amino acids in the P1 position of the substrate, Leu being the most efficiently cleaved.

This family corresponds to several clans in the MEROPS database, including the MH clan, which contains 4 families (M18, M20, M28, M42). The peptidase M20 family includes carboxypeptidases such as the glutamate carboxypeptidase from Pseudomonas, the thermostable carboxypeptidase Ss1 of broad specificity from archaea and yeast Gly-X carboxypeptidase. The dipeptidases include bacterial dipeptidase, peptidase V (PepV), a eukaryotic, non-specific dipeptidase, and two Xaa-His dipeptidases (carnosinases). There is also the bacterial aminopeptidase, peptidase T (PepT) that acts only on tripeptide substrates and has therefore been termed a tripeptidase. Peptidase family M28 contains aminopeptidases and carboxypeptidases, and has co-catalytic zinc ions. However, several enzymes in this family utilize other first row transition metal ions such as cobalt and manganese. Each zinc ion is tetrahedrally co-ordinated, with three amino acid ligands plus activated water; one aspartate residue binds both metal ions. The aminopeptidases in this family are also called bacterial leucyl aminopeptidases, but are able to release a variety of N-terminal amino acids. IAP aminopeptidase and aminopeptidase Y preferentially release basic amino acids while glutamate carboxypeptidase II preferentially releases C-terminal glutamates. Glutamate carbxypeptidase II and plasma glutamate carboxypeptidase hydrolyze dipeptides. Peptidase families M18 and M42 contain metalloaminopeptidases. M18 is widely distributed in bacteria and eukaryotes. However, only yeast aminopeptidase I and mammalian aspartyl aminopeptidase have been characterized in detail. Some of M42 (also known as glutamyl aminopeptidase) enzymes exhibit aminopeptidase specificity while others also have acylaminoacylpeptidase activity (i.e. hydrolysis of acylated N-terminal residues).

BipA was originally described as a protein that is induced in Salmonella typhimurium after exposure to bactericidal/permeability-inducing protein (a cationic antimicrobial protein produced by neutrophils), and has since been identified in E. coli as well. The properties thus far described for BipA are related to its role in the process of pathogenesis by enteropathogenic E. coli. It appears to be involved in the regulation of several processes important for infection, including rearrangements of the cytoskeleton of the host, bacterial resistance to host defense peptides, flagellum-mediated cell motility, and expression of K5 capsular genes. It has been proposed that BipA may utilize a novel mechanism to regulate the expression of target genes. In addition, BipA from enteropathogenic E. coli has been shown to be phosphorylated on a tyrosine residue, while BipA from Salmonella and from E. coli K12 strains is not phosphorylated under the conditions assayed. The phosphorylation apparently modifies the rate of nucleotide hydrolysis, with the phosphorylated form showing greatly increased GTPase activity.

This domain includes the carboxyl terminal regions of elongation factors (EFs) bacterial EF-G, eukaryotic and archeal EF-2 and eukaryotic mitochondrial mtEFG1s and mtEFG2s. This group also includes proteins similar to the ribosomal protection proteins Tet(M) and Tet(O), BipA, LepA and, spliceosomal proteins: human 116kD U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) protein (U5-116 kD) and yeast counterpart Snu114p.  This domain adopts a ferredoxin-like fold consisting of an alpha-beta sandwich with anti-parallel beta-sheets, resembling the topology of domain III found in the elongation factors EF-G and eukaryotic EF-2, with which it forms the C-terminal block. The two domains however are not superimposable and domain III lacks some of the characteristics of this domain.  EF-2/EF-G in complex with GTP, promotes the translocation step of translation. During translocation the peptidyl-tRNA is moved from the A site to the P site, the uncharged tRNA from the P site to the E-site and, the mRNA is shifted one codon relative to the ribosome. Tet(M) and Tet(O) mediate Tc resistance. Typical Tcs bind to the ribosome and inhibit the elongation phase of protein synthesis, by inhibiting the occupation of site A by aminoacyl-tRNA. Tet(M) and Tet(O) catalyze the release of tetracycline (Tc) from the ribosome in a GTP-dependent manner.  BipA is a highly conserved protein with global regulatory properties in Escherichia coli. Yeast Snu114p is essential for cell viability and for splicing in vivo. Experiments suggest that GTP binding and probably GTP hydrolysis is important for the function of the U5-116 kD/Snu114p.

One of the pathogenic mechanisms of P. aeruginosa is to induce cytotoxicity by the injection of effector proteins (e.g. ExoU) using the type III secretion (T3S) system. ExoU is homologus to patatin and also has the conserved catalytic residues of mammalian calcium-independent (iPLA2) and cytosolic (cPLA2) PLA2. In vitro, ExoU cytotoxity is blocked by the inhibitor of cytosolic and Ca2-independent phospholipase A2 (cPLA2 and iPLA2) enzymes, suggesting that phospholipase A2 inhibitors may represent a novel mode of treatment for acute P. aeruginosa infections. ExoU requires eukaryotic superoxide dismutase as a cofactor and cleaves phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine in vitro. VipD, a 69-kDa cytosolic protein, belongs to the members of Legionella pneumophila family and is homologus to ExoU from Pseudomonas. Even though VipD shows high sequence similarity with several functional regions of ExoU (e.g. oxyanion hole, active site serine, active site aspartate), it has been shown to have no phospholipase activity.

The SIS domain is found in many phosphosugar isomerases and phosphosugar binding proteins. GlmS contains a N-terminal glutaminase domain and two C-terminal SIS domains and catalyzes the first step in hexosamine metabolism, converting fructose 6-phosphate into glucosamine 6-phosphate using glutamine as nitrogen source. The glutaminase domain hydrolyzes glutamine to glutamate and ammonia. Ammonia is transferred through a channel to the isomerase domain for glucosamine 6-phosphate synthesis. The end product of the pathway is N-acetylglucosamine, which plays multiple roles in eukaryotic cells including being a building block of bacterial and fungal cell walls. In the absence of glutamine, GlmS catalyzes the isomerization of fructose 6-phosphate into glucose 6- phosphate (PGI-like activity). Glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase (GlmD) contains two SIS domains and catalyzes the deamination and isomerization of glucosamine-6-phosphate into fructose-6-phosphate with the release of ammonia; in presence of high ammonia concentration, GlmD can catalyze the reverse reaction.

Eukaryotic Smg5 and Smg6 nucleases are essential factors in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a post-transcriptional regulatory pathway that recognizes and rapidly degrades mRNAs containing premature translation termination codons. In vivo, the Smg6 PIN domain elicits degradation of bound mRNAs, as well as, metal ion dependent, degradation of single-stranded RNA, in vitro. These PIN domains are homologs of flap endonuclease-1 (FEN1)-like PIN domains, but lack the extensive arch/clamp region  and the H3TH (helix-3-turn-helix) domain, an atypical helix-hairpin-helix-2-like region, seen in FEN1-like PIN domains.  PIN domains within this subgroup contain four highly conserved acidic residues (putative metal-binding, active site residues). Many of the bacterial homologs in this group have an N-terminal PIN domain and a C-terminal PhoH-like ATPase domain and are predicted to be ATPases which are induced by phosphate starvation.

PIN domains were originally named for their sequence similarity to the N-terminal domain of an annotated pili biogenesis protein, PilT, a domain fusion between a PIN-domain and a PilT ATPase domain.  The structural properties of the PIN domain indicate its putative active center, consisting of invariant acidic amino acid residues (putative metal-binding residues) is geometrically similar in the active center of structure-specific 5&apos; nucleases (also known as Flap endonuclease-1-like), PIN-domain ribonucleases of eukaryotic rRNA editing proteins, and bacterial toxins of toxin-antitoxin (TA) operons. Seen here, are two major divisions in the PIN domain superfamily. The first major division, the structure-specific 5&apos; nuclease family, is represented by FEN1, the 5&apos;-3&apos; exonuclease of DNA polymerase I, and T4 RNase H nuclease PIN domains. These 5&apos; nucleases are involved in DNA replication, repair, and recombination. They are capable of both 5&apos;-3&apos; exonucleolytic activity and cleaving bifurcated DNA, in an endonucleolytic, structure-specific manner. Unique to FEN1-like nucleases, the PIN domain has a helical arch/clamp region (I domain) of variable length (approximately 16 to 800 residues) and, inserted within the C-terminal region of the PIN domain, a H3TH (helix-3-turn-helix) domain, an atypical helix-hairpin-helix-2-like region. Both the H3TH domain (not included here) and the helical arch/clamp region are involved in DNA binding. With the exception of Mkt1, these nucleases have a carboxylate rich active site that is involved in binding essential divalent metal ion cofactors (Mg2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, or Co2+).  The second major division of the PIN domain superfamily, the VapC-Smg6 family, includes such eukaryotic ribonucleases as, Smg6, an essential factor in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay; Rrp44, the catalytic subunit of the exosome; and Nob1, a ribosome assembly factor critical in pre-rRNA processing. A large percentage of members in this family are bacterial ribonuclease toxins of TA operons such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis VapC and Neisseria gonorrhoeae FitB, as well as, archaeal homologs, Pyrobaculum aerophilum Pea0151 and P. aerophilum Pae2754. Also included are the eukaryotic Fcf1/ Utp24 (FAF1-copurifying factor 1/U three-associated protein 24) and Utp23-like proteins.

CSP&apos;s include the major cold-shock proteins CspA and CspB in bacteria and the eukaryotic gene regulatory factor Y-box protein. CSP expression is up-regulated by an abrupt drop in growth temperature. CSP&apos;s are also expressed under normal condition at lower level. The function of cold-shock proteins is not fully understood. They preferentially bind poly-pyrimidine region of single-stranded RNA and DNA.  CSP&apos;s are thought to bind mRNA and regulate ribosomal translation, mRNA degradation, and  the rate of transcription termination. The human Y-box protein, which contains a CSD, regulates transcription and translation of genes that contain the Y-box sequence in their promoters. This specific ssDNA-binding properties of CSD are required for the binding of Y-box protein to the promoter&apos;s Y-box sequence, thereby regulating transcription.

Classical SDRs are typically about 250 residues long, while extended SDRs are approximately 350 residues. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold NAD-binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns. These enzymes catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human prostaglandin dehydrogenase (PGDH) numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, PGDH numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, PGDH numbering) contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Extended SDRs have additional elements in the C-terminal region, and typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase (KR) domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type KRs have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif. Some atypical SDRs have lost catalytic activity and/or have an unusual NAD(P)-binding motif and missing or unusual active site residues. Reactions catalyzed within the SDR family include isomerization, decarboxylation, epimerization, C=N bond reduction, dehydratase activity, dehalogenation, Enoyl-CoA reduction, and carbonyl-alcohol oxidoreduction.

Gamma-glutamyl cyclotransferase (GGCT) catalyzes the formation of pyroglutamic acid (5-oxoproline) from dipeptides containing gamma-glutamyl, and is a dimeric protein. In Homo sapiens, the protein is encoded by the gene C7orf24, and the enzyme participates in the gamma-glutamyl cycle. Hereditary defects in the gamma-glutamyl cycle have been described for some of the genes involved, but not for C7orf24. The synthesis and metabolism of glutathione (L-gamma-glutamyl-L-cysteinylglycine) ties the gamma-glutamyl cycle to numerous cellular processes; glutathione acts as a ubiquitous reducing agent in reductive mechanisms involved in protein and DNA synthesis, transport processes, enzyme activity, and metabolism. AIG2 (avrRpt2-induced gene) is an Arabidopsis protein that exhibits RPS2- and avrRpt2-dependent induction early after infection with Pseudomonas syringae pv maculicola strain ES4326 carrying avrRpt2. avrRpt2 is an avirulence gene that can convert virulent strains of P. syringae to avirulence on Arabidopsis thaliana, soybean, and bean.

Philadelphia 1]]	superfamily	276298	18	254	6.28397e-79	240.642	cl21454	SDR superfamily	 - 	 - 	Short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR); SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet), an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Classical SDRs are typically about 250 residues long, while extended SDRs are approximately 350 residues. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold NAD-binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns. These enzymes catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human prostaglandin dehydrogenase (PGDH) numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, PGDH numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, PGDH numbering) contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Extended SDRs have additional elements in the C-terminal region, and typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase (KR) domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type KRs have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif. Some atypical SDRs have lost catalytic activity and/or have an unusual NAD(P)-binding motif and missing or unusual active site residues. Reactions catalyzed within the SDR family include isomerization, decarboxylation, epimerization, C=N bond reduction, dehydratase activity, dehalogenation, Enoyl-CoA reduction, and carbonyl-alcohol oxidoreduction.

The five known T-folds are found in five different enzymes with different functions: dihydroneopterin-triphosphate epimerase (DHNTPE), dihydroneopterin aldolase (DHNA) , GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH-1),  6-pyrovoyl tetrahydropterin synthetase (PTPS), and uricase (UO,uroate/urate oxidase). They bind to substrates belonging to the purine or pterin families, and share a fold-related binding site with a glutamate or glutamine residue anchoring the substrate and a lot of conserved interactions. They also share a similar oligomerization mode: several T-folds join together to form a beta(2n)alpha(n) barrel, then two barrels join together in a head-to-head fashion to made up the native enzymes. The functional enzyme is a tetramer for UO, a hexamer for PTPS, an octamer for DHNA/DHNTPE and a decamer for GTPCH-1. The substrate is located in a deep and narrow pocket at the interface between monomers. In PTPS, the active site is located at the interface of three monomers, two from one trimer and one from the other trimer. In GTPCH-1, it is also located at the interface of three subunits, two from one pentamer and one from the other pentamer. There are four equivalent active sites in UO, six in PTPS, eight in DHNA/DHNTPE and ten in GTPCH-1.   Each globular multimeric enzyme encloses a tunnel which is lined with charged residues for DHNA and UO, and with basic residues in PTPS. The N and C-terminal ends are located on one side of the T-fold while the residues involved in the catalytic activity are located at the opposite side. In PTPS, UO and DHNA/DHNTPE, the N and C-terminal extremities of the enzyme are located on the exterior side of the functional multimeric enzyme. In GTPCH-1, the extra C-terminal helix places the extremity inside the tunnel.

Members of this family are well represented in a variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Phylogenetic analysis reveals two distinct subgroups where plant enzymes fall into one group (represented by this subfamily) and fungi/animals/archaea enzymes fall into another. Bacterial enzymes are found in both subfamilies. Ap4A is a potential by-product of aminoacyl tRNA synthesis, and accumulation of Ap4A has been implicated in a range of biological events, such as DNA replication, cellular differentiation, heat shock, metabolic stress, and apoptosis. Ap4A hydrolase cleaves Ap4A asymmetrically into ATP and AMP. It is important in the invasive properties of bacteria and thus presents a potential target for the inhibition of such invasive bacteria. Besides the signature nudix motif (G[X5]E[X7]REUXEEXGU where U is Ile, Leu, or Val), Ap4A hydrolase is structurally similar to the other members of the nudix superfamily with some degree of variations.

Enzymes belonging to this superfamily require a divalent cation, such as Mg2+ or Mn2+ for their activity. Members of this family are recognized by a highly conserved 23-residue nudix motif (GX5EX7REUXEEXGU, where U = I, L or V), which forms a structural motif that functions as a metal binding and catalytic site. Substrates of nudix hydrolase include intact and oxidatively damaged nucleoside triphosphates, dinucleoside polyphosphates, nucleotide-sugars and dinucleotide enzymes. These substrates are metabolites or cell signaling molecules that require regulation during different stages of the cell cycle or during periods of stress. In general, the role of the nudix hydrolase is to sanitize the nucleotide pools and to maintain cell viability, thereby serving as surveillance and &quot;house-cleaning&quot; enzymes. Substrate specificity is used to define child families within the superfamily. Differences in substrate specificity are determined by the N-terminal extension or by residues in variable loop regions. Mechanistically, substrate hydrolysis occurs by a nucleophilic substitution reaction, with variation in the numbers and roles of divalent cations required. This superfamily consists of at least nine families: IPP (isopentenyl diphosphate) isomerase, ADP ribose pyrophosphatase, mutT pyrophosphohydrolase, coenzyme-A pyrophosphatase, MTH1-7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine-triphosphatase, diadenosine tetraphosphate hydrolase, NADH pyrophosphatase, GDP-mannose hydrolase and the c-terminal portion of the mutY adenine glycosylase.

GlmU is an essential bacterial enzyme with both an acetyltransferase and an uridyltransferase activity which have been mapped to the C-terminal and N-terminal domains, respectively. This family represents the N-terminal uridyltransferase. GlmU performs the last two steps in the synthesis of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), which is an essential precursor in both the peptidoglycan and the lipopolysaccharide metabolic pathways in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively.

Based on the stereochemistry of the donor and acceptor molecules, GTs are classified as either retaining or inverting enzymes. To date, all GT structures adopt one of two possible folds, termed GT-A fold and GT-B fold.  This hierarchy includes diverse families of glycosyl transferases with a common GT-A type structural fold, which has two tightly associated beta/alpha/beta domains that tend to form a continuous central sheet of at least eight beta-strands. The majority of the proteins in this superfamily are Glycosyltransferase family 2 (GT-2) proteins. But it also includes families GT-43, GT-6, GT-8, GT13 and GT-7; which are evolutionarily related to GT-2 and share structure similarities.

It is a bifunctional bacterial enzyme that catalyzes two consecutive steps in the formation of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), an important precursor in bacterial cell wall formation. The two enzymatic activities, uridyltransferase and acetyltransferase, are carried out by two independent domains. The C-terminal LbH domain possesses the acetyltransferase activity. It catalyzes the CoA-dependent acetylation of GlcN-1-phosphate to GlcNAc-1-phosphate. The LbH domain contains 10 turns, each containing three imperfect tandem repeats of a hexapeptide repeat motif (X-[STAV]-X-[LIV]-[GAED]-X. The acetyltransferase active site is located at the interface between two subunits of the active LbH trimer.

Members of this subfamily are found in all three kingdoms of life. It is functionally diverse subfamily, in addition to the CorA Co2+ transporter from the hyperthermophilic Thermotoga maritima, it includes Methanosarcina mazei CorA which may be involved in transport of copper and/or other divalent metal ions. Thermotoga maritima CorA forms funnel-shaped homopentamers, the tip of the funnel is formed from two C-terminal transmembrane (TM) helices from each monomer, and the large opening of the funnel from the N-terminal cytoplasmic domains. The GMN signature motif of the MIT superfamily occurs just after TM1, mutation within this motif is known to abolish Mg2+ transport by a related protein, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Alr1p. Natural variants in this signature sequence may be associated with the transport of different divalent cations. The functional diversity of the MIT superfamily may also be due to minor structural differences regulating gating, substrate selection, and transport.

They are found in most bacteria and archaea, and in some eukaryotes. It is a functionally diverse group which includes the Mg2+ transporters of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium CorAs (which can also transport Co2+, and Ni2+ ), the CorA Co2+ transporter from the hyperthermophilic Thermotoga maritima, and the Zn2+ transporter Salmonella typhimurium ZntB, which mediates the efflux of Zn2+ (and Cd2+). It includes five Saccharomyces cerevisiae members: i) two plasma membrane proteins, the Mg2+ transporter Alr1p/Swc3p and the putative Mg2+ transporter, Alr2p, ii) two mitochondrial inner membrane Mg2+ transporters: Mfm1p/Lpe10p, and Mrs2p, and iii) and the vacuole membrane protein Mnr2p, a putative Mg2+ transporter. It also includes a family of Arabidopsis thaliana members (AtMGTs), some of which are localized to distinct tissues, and not all of which can transport Mg2+. Thermotoga maritima CorA and Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Salmonella typhimurium ZntB form funnel-shaped homopentamers, the tip of the funnel is formed from two C-terminal transmembrane (TM) helices from each monomer, and the large opening of the funnel from the N-terminal cytoplasmic domains. The GMN signature motif of the MIT superfamily occurs just after TM1, mutation within this motif is known to abolish Mg2+ transport through Salmonella typhimurium CorA, Mrs2p, and Alr1p. Natural variants such as GVN and GIN, as in some ZntB family proteins, may be associated with the transport of different divalent cations, such as zinc and cadmium. The functional diversity of MIT transporters may also be due to minor structural differences regulating gating, substrate selection, and transport.
